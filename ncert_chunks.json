The regular\nrepetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons,\nthe eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always\nbeen a source of wonder. The world has an astonishing variety\nof materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behaviour.\nThe inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded\nto the wonder and awe of nature in different ways. One kind\nof response from the earliest times has been to observe the\nphysical environment carefully, look for any meaningful\npatterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and\nuse new tools to interact with nature.  This human endeavour\nled, in course of time, to modern science and technology.\nThe word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia\nmeaning \u2018 to know \u2019.  The Sanskrit word Vij\u00f1\u00e3n and the Arabic\nword Ilm convey similar meaning, namely \u2018knowledge\u2019.\nScience, in a broad sense, is as old as human species. The\nearly civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia\nand many others made vital contributions to its progress.\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made\nin science in Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century,\nscience had become a truly international enterprise, with\nmany cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.\nWhat is Science and what is the so-called Scientific\nMetho d?  Science is a systematic attempt to understand\nnatural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible,\nand use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and\ncontrol phenomena. Science is exploring, experimenting and\npredicting from what we see around us. The curiosity to learn\nabout the world, unravelling the secrets of nature is the first\nstep towards the discovery of science. The scientific method\ninvolves several interconnected steps : Systematic\nobservations, controlled experiments, qualitative andCHAPTER  ONE\nPHYSICAL  WORLD\n1.1 What is physics ?\n1.2 Scope and excitement of\nphysics\n1.3 Physics, technology and\nsociety\n1.4 Fundamental forces in\nnature\n1.5 Nature of physical laws\nSummary\nExercises\n2020-21",

Speculation and\nconjecture also have a place in science; but\nultimately, a scientific theory, to be acceptable,\nmust be verified by relevant observations  or\nexperiments. There is much philosophical\ndebate about the nature and method of science\nthat we need not discuss here.\nThe interplay of theory and observation (or\nexperiment) is basic to the progress of science.\nScience is ever dynamic. There is no \u2018final\u2019\ntheory in science and no unquestioned\nauthority among scientists.  As observations\nimprove in detail and precision or experiments\nyield new results, theories must account for\nthem, if necessary, by introducing modifications.\nSometimes the modifications may not be drastic\nand may lie within the framework of existing\ntheory.  For example, when Johannes Kepler\n(1571-1630) examined the extensive data on\nplanetary motion collected by Tycho Brahe\n(1546-1601), the planetary circular orbits in\nheliocentric  theory (sun at the centre of the\nsolar system) imagined by Nicolas Copernicus\n(1473\u20131543) had to be replaced by elliptical\norbits to fit the data better.  Occasionally,\nhowever, the  existing theory is simply unable\nto explain new observations.  This causes a\nmajor upheaval in science. In the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, it was realised that\nNewtonian mechanics, till then a very\nsuccessful theory, could not explain some of the\nmost basic features of atomic phenomena.\nSimilarly, the then accepted wave picture of light\nfailed to explain the photoelectric effect properly.\nThis led to the development of a  radically new\ntheory ( Quantum Mechanics ) to deal with atomic\nand molecular phenomena.\nJust as a new experiment may suggest an\nalternative theoretical model, a theoretical\nadvance may suggest what to look for in some\nexperiments.  The result of experiment of\nscattering of alpha particles by gold foil, in 1911\nby Ernest Rutherford (1871\u20131937) established\nthe nuclear model of the atom, which then\nbecame the basis of the quantum theory of\nhydrogen atom given in 1913 by Niels Bohr\n(1885\u20131962). On the other hand, the concept of\nantiparticle was first introduced theoretically by\nPaul Dirac (1902\u20131984) in 1930 and confirmed\ntwo years later by the experimental discovery of\npositron (antielectron) by Carl Anderson.Physics is a basic discipline in the category\nof Natural Sciences , which also includes other\ndisciplines like Chemistry and Biology. The word\nPhysics  comes from a Greek word meaning\nnature. Its Sanskrit equivalent is Bhautiki  that\nis used to refer to the study of the physical world.\nA precise definition of this discipline is neither\npossible nor necessary.  We can broadly describe\nphysics as a study of the basic laws of  nature\nand their manifestation in different natural\nphenomena.  The scope of physics is described\nbriefly in the next section.  Here we remark on\ntwo principal  thrusts in physics :  unification\nand reduction .\nIn Physics, we attempt to explain diverse\nphysical phenomena in terms of a few concepts\nand laws .  The effort is to see the physical world\nas manifestation of some universal laws in\ndifferent domains and conditions.  For example,\nthe same law of gravitation (given by Newton)\ndescribes the fall of an apple to the ground, the\nmotion of the moon around the earth and the\nmotion of planets around the sun. Similarly, the\nbasic laws of electromagnetism (Maxwell\u2019s\nequations) govern all electric and magnetic\nphenomena. The attempts to unify fundamental\nforces of nature (section 1.4) reflect this same\nquest for unification.\nA related effort is to derive the properties of a\nbigger, more complex, system from the properties\nand interactions of its constituent simpler parts.\nThis approach is called reductionism  and is\nat the heart of physics.  For example, the subject\nof thermodynamics, developed in the nineteenth\ncentury, deals with bulk systems in terms of\nmacroscopic quantities such as temperature,\ninternal energy, entropy, etc.  Subsequently, the\nsubjects of kinetic theory and statistical\nmechanics interpreted these quantities in terms\nof the properties of the molecular constituents\nof the bulk system.  In particular, the\ntemperature was seen to be related to the average\nkinetic energy of molecules  of the system.\n1.2  SCOPE AND EXCITEMENT OF PHYSICS\nWe can get some idea of the scope of physics by\nlooking at its various sub-disciplines.  Basically,\nthere are two domains of interest : macroscopic\nand microscopic. The macroscopic domain\nincludes phenomena at the laboratory, terrestrial\nand astronomical scales. The microscopic domain\nincludes atomic, molecular and nuclear\n2020-21",

    "content": "PHYSICS 4\nPhysics is exciting in many ways. To some people\nthe excitement comes from the elegance and\nuniversality of its basic theories, from the fact that\na few basic concepts and laws can explain\nphenomena covering a large range of magnitude\nof physical quantities. To some others, the challenge\nin carrying out imaginative new experiments to\nunlock the secrets of nature, to verify or refute\ntheories, is thrilling.  Applied physics is equally\ndemanding. Application and exploitation of\nphysical laws to make useful devices is the most\ninteresting and exciting part and requires great\ningenuity and persistence of effort.\nWhat lies behind the phenomenal progress\nof physics in the last few centuries? Great\nprogress usually accompanies changes in our\nbasic perceptions.  First, it was realised that for\nscientific progress, only qualitative thinking,\nthough no doubt important, is not enough.\nQuantitative measurement is central to the\ngrowth of science, especially physics, because\nthe laws of nature happen to be expressible in\nprecise mathematical equations. The second\nmost important insight was that the basic laws\nof physics are  universal  \u2014 the same laws apply\nin widely different con texts. Lastly, the strategy\nof approximation turned out to be very\nsuccessful.  Most observed phenomena in daily\nlife are rather complicated manifestations of the\nbasic laws. Scientists recognised the importance\nof extracting the essential features of a\nphenomenon from its less significant aspects.\nIt is not practical to take into account all the\ncomplexities of a phenomenon in one go.  A good\nstrategy is to focus first on the essential features,\ndiscover the basic principles and then introduce\ncorrections to build a more refined theory of the\nphenomenon. For example, a stone and a feather\ndropped from the same height do not reach the\nground at the same time. The reason is that the\nessential aspect of the phenomenon, namely free\nfall under gravity, is complicated by the\npresence of air resistance. To get the law of free\nfall under gravity, it is better to create a\nsituation wherein the air resistance is\nnegligible. We can, for example, let the stone and\nthe feather fall through a long evacuated tube.\nIn that case, the two objects will fall almost at\nthe same rate, giving the basic law that\nacceleration due to gravity is independent of the\nmass of the object.  With the basic law thus\nfound, we can go back to the feather, introduce\ncorrections due to air resistance, modify the\nexisting theory and try to build a more realisticHypothesis, axioms and models\nOne should not think that everything can be proved\nwith physics and mathematics. All physics, and also\nmathematics, is based on assumptions, each of\nwhich is variously called a hypothesis or axiom or\npostulate, etc.\nFor example, the universal law of gravitation\nproposed by Newton is an assumption or hypothesis,\nwhich he proposed out of his ingenuity. Before him,\nthere were several observations, experiments and\ndata, on the motion of planets around the sun,\nmotion of the moon around the earth, pendulums,\nbodies falling towards the earth etc. Each of these\nrequired a separate explanation, which was more\nor less qualitative. What the universal law of\ngravitation says is that, if we assume  that any two\nbodies in the universe attract each other with a\nforce proportional to the product of their masses\nand inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance between them, then we can explain all\nthese observations in one stroke. It not only explains\nthese phenomena, it also allows us to predict the\nresults of future experiments.\nA hypothesis is a supposition without assuming\nthat it is true. It would not be fair to ask anybody\nto prove the universal law of gravitation, because\nit cannot be proved. It can be verified and\nsubstantiated by experiments and observations.\nAn axiom is a self-evident truth while a model\nis a theory proposed to explain observed\nphenomena. But you need not worry at this stage\nabout the nuances in using these words. For\nexample, next year you will learn about Bohr\u2019s model\nof hydrogen atom, in which Bohr assumed that an\nelectron in the hydrogen atom follows certain rules\n(postutates). Why did he do that? There was a large\namount of spectroscopic data before him which no\nother theory could explain. So Bohr said that if we\nassume that an atom behaves in such a manner,\nwe can explain all these things at once.\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity is also\nbased on two postulates, the constancy of the speed\nof electromagnetic radiation and the validity of\nphysical laws in all inertial frame of reference. It\nwould not be wise to ask somebody to prove that\nthe speed of light in vacuum is constant,\nindependent of the source or observer.\nIn mathematics too, we need axioms and\nhypotheses at every stage. Euclid\u2019s statement that\nparallel lines never meet, is a hypothesis. This means\nthat if we assume this statement, we can explain\nseveral properties of straight lines and two or three\ndimensional figures made out of them. But if you\ndon\u2019t assume it, you are free to use a different axiom\nand get a new geometry, as has indeed happened in\nthe past few centuries and decades.\n2020-21",

The\ndiscipline of thermodynamics arose from the\nneed to understand and improve the working of\nheat engines.  The steam engine, as we know,\nis inseparable from the Industrial Revolution in\nEngland in the eighteenth century, which had\ngreat impact on the course of human\ncivilisation. Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates\nnew technology. An example of the latter is the\nwireless communication technology that followed\nthe discovery of the basic laws of electricity and\nmagnetism in the nineteenth century. The\napplications of  physics are not always easy to\nforesee. As late as 1933, the great physicist\nErnest Rutherford had dismissed the possibility\nof tapping energy from atoms. But only a few\nyears later, in 1938, Hahn and Meitner\ndiscovered the phenomenon of neutron-induced\nfission of uranium, which would serve as the\nbasis of nuclear power reactors and nuclear\nweapons. Yet another important example of\nphysics giving rise to technology is the silicon\n\u2018chip\u2019 that triggered  the computer revolution in\nthe last three decades of the twentieth century.A most significant area to which physics has\nand will contribute is the development of\nalternative energy resources.  The fossil fuels of\nthe planet are dwindling fast and there is an\nurgent need to discover new and affordable\nsources of energy.

We shall now discuss the\nnature of fundamental forces and the laws that\ngovern the diverse phenomena of the physical\nworld.\n1.4  FUNDAMENTAL FORCES IN NATURE *\nWe all have an intuitive notion of force.

    "content": "PHYSICS 8\n1.4.1 Gravitational Force\nThe gravitational force is the force of mutual\nattraction between any two objects by virtue of\ntheir masses. It is a universal force. Every object\nexperiences this force due to every other object\nin the universe. All objects on the earth, for\nexample, experience the force of gravity due to\nthe earth. In particular, gravity governs the\nmotion of the moon and artificial satellites around\nthe earth, motion of the earth and planets\naround the sun, and, of course, the motion of\nbodies falling to the earth.  It plays a key role in\nthe large-scale phenomena of the universe, such\nas formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and\ngalactic clusters.\n1.4.2  Electromagnetic Force\nElectromagnetic force is the force between\ncharged particles.  In the simpler case when\ncharges are at rest, the force is given by\nCoulomb\u2019s law : attractive for unlike charges and\nrepulsive for like charges . Charges in motion\nproduce magnetic effects and a magnetic field\ngives rise to a force on a moving charge. Electric\nand magnetic effects are, in general,\ninseparable  \u2013 hence the name electromagnetic\nforce. Like the gravitational force,\nelectromagnetic force acts over large distances\nand does not need any intervening medium. It\nis enormously strong compared to gravity. Theelectric force between two protons, for example,\nis 1036 times the gravitational force between\nthem, for any fixed distance.\nMatter, as we know, consists of elementary\ncharged constituents like electrons and\nprotons. Since the electromagnetic force is so\nmuch stronger than the gravitational force, it\ndominates all phenomena at atomic and\nmolecular scales.  (The other two forces, as we\nshall see, operate only at nuclear scales.)  Thus\nit is mainly the electromagnetic force that\ngoverns the structure of atoms and molecules,\nthe dynamics of  chemical reactions and the\nmechanical, thermal and other properties of\nmaterials.  It underlies the macroscopic forces\nlike  \u2018tension\u2019, \u2018friction\u2019, \u2018normal force\u2019, \u2018spring\nforce\u2019, et c.\nGravity is always attractive, while\nelectromagnetic force can be attractive or\nrepulsive.  Another way of putting it is that mass\ncomes only in one variety (there is no negative\nmass), but charge comes in two varieties :\npositive and negative charge. This is what\nmakes all the difference.  Matter is mostly\nelectrically neutral (net charge is zero). Thus,\nelectric force is largely zero and gravitational\nforce dominates terrestrial phenomena. Electric\nforce manifests itself in atmosphere where the\natoms are ion ised and that leads to lightning.Albert Einstein (1879-1955)\nAlbert Einstein, born in Ulm, Germany in 1879, is universally regarded as\none of the greatest physicists of all time. His astonishing scientific career\nbegan with the publication of three path-breaking papers in 1905.  In the\nfirst paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons)\nand used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect that the classical\nwave theory of radiation could not account for.  In the second paper, he\ndeveloped a theory of Brownian motion that was confirmed experimentally\na few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of\nmatter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity that\nmade Einstein a legend in his own life time.  In the next decade, he explored the consequences of his\nnew theory which included, among other things, the mass-energy equivalence enshrined in his famous\nequation E = mc2.  He also created the general version of relativity (The General Theory of Relativity),\nwhich is the modern theory of gravitation. Some of Einstein\u2019s most significant later contributions are:\nthe notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck\u2019s blackbody radiation\nlaw, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of\nmassive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. The year 2005 was\ndeclared as International Year of  Physics, in recognition of  Einstein\u2019s monumental contribution to\nphysics, in year 1905, describing revolutionary scientific ideas that have since influenced all of modern\nphysics.\n2020-21",

Indeed, to be consistent,\nin that circumstance, we ourselves would\ncrumble under our own weight !\n1.4.3  Strong Nuclear Force\nThe strong nuclear force binds protons and\nneutrons in a nucleus. It is evident that without\nsome attractive force, a nucleus will be\nunstable due to the electric repulsion between\nits protons. This attractive force cannot be\ngravitational since force of gravity is negligible\ncompared to the electric force. A new basic force\nmust, therefore, be  invoked. The  strong nuclear\nforce  is  the  strongest of all fundamental forces,\nabout 100 times the electromagnetic force instrength.  It is charge-independent and acts\nequally between a proton and a proton, a\nneutron and a neutron, and a proton and a\nneutron. Its range is, however, extremely small,\nof about nuclear dimensions (10\u201315m). It is\nresponsible for the stability of nuclei. The\nelectron, it must be noted, does not experience\nthis force.\nRecent developments have, however,\nindicated that protons and neutrons are built\nout of still more elementary constituents called\nquarks.\n1.4.4  Weak Nuclear Force\nThe weak nuclear force appears only in certain\nnuclear processes such as the \u03b2-decay of a\nnucleus. In \u03b2-decay, the nucleus emits an\nelectron and an uncharged particle called\nneutrino.  The weak nuclear force is not as weak\nas the gravitational force, but much weaker\nthan the strong nuclear and electromagnetic\nforces. The range of weak nuclear force is\nexceedingly small, of the order of 10\u201316 m.\n1.4.5   Towards Unification of  Forces\nWe remarked in section 1.1 that unification is a\nbasic quest in physics. Great advances in\nphysics often amount to unification of differentSatyendranath Bose (1894-1974)\nSatyendranath Bose, born in Calcutta in 1894, is among the great Indian\nphysicists who made a fundamental contribution to the advance of science\nin the twentieth century. An outstanding student throughout, Bose started\nhis career in 1916 as a lecturer in physics in Calcutta University; five years\nlater he joined Dacca University.  Here in 1924, in a brilliant flash of insight,\nBose gave a new derivation of Planck\u2019s law, treating radiation as a gas of\nphotons and employing new statistical methods of counting of photon states.\nHe wrote a short paper on the subject and sent it to Einstein who\nimmediately recognised its great significance, translated it in German and\nforwarded it for publication.  Einstein then applied the same method to a\ngas of molecules.\nThe key new conceptual ingredient in Bose\u2019s work was that the particles were regarded as\nindistinguishable, a radical departure from the assumption that underlies the classical Maxwell-\nBoltzmann statistics. It was soon realised that the new Bos e-Einstein statistics was applicable to\nparticles with integers spins, and a new quantum statistics (Ferm i-Dirac statistics) was needed for\nparticles with half integers spins satisfying Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle. Particles with integers spins\nare now known as bosons in honour of Bose.\nAn important consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics is that a gas of molecules below a certain\ntemperature will undergo a phase transition to a state where a large fraction of atoms populate the\nsame lowest energy state. Some seventy years were to pass before the pioneering ideas of Bose, developed\nfurther by Einstein, were dramatically confirmed in the observation of a new state of matter in a dilute\ngas of ultra cold alkali atoms - the Bose-Eintein  condensate.\n2020-21",

The experimental discoveries of\nOersted and Faraday showed that electric and\nmagnetic phenomena are in general\ninseparable.  Maxwell unified electromagnetism\nand optics with the discovery that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave.  Einstein attempted to\nunify gravity and electromagnetism but could\nnot succeed in this venture. But this did not\ndeter physicists from zealously pursuing the\ngoal of unification of forces.\nRecent decades have seen much progress on\nthis front.  The electromagnetic and the weak\nnuclear force have now been unified and are\nseen as aspects of a single \u2018electro-weak\u2019 force.\nWhat this unification actually means cannot\nbe explained here. Attempts have been (and are\nbeing) made to unify the electro-weak and the\nstrong force and even to unify the gravitational\nforce with the rest of the fundamental forces.\nMany of these ideas are still speculative and\ninconclusive. Table 1.4 summarises some of the\nmilestones in the progress towards unification\nof forces in nature.1.5   NATURE OF PHYSICAL LAWS\nPhysicists explore the universe. Their\ninvestigations, based on scientific processes,\nrange from particles that are smaller than\natoms in size to stars that are very far away. In\naddition to finding the facts by observation and\nexperimentation, physicists attempt to discover\nthe laws that summarise (often as mathematical\nequations) these facts.\nIn any physical phenomenon governed by\ndifferent forces, several quantities may change\nwith time. A remarkable fact is that some special\nphysical quantities, however, remain constant\nin time. They are the conserved quantities of\nnature. Understanding these conservation\nprinciples is very important to describe the\nobserved phenomena quantitatively.\nFor motion under an external conservative\nforce, the total mechanical energy i.e. the sum\nof kinetic and potential energy of a body is a\nconstant. The familiar example is the free fall of\nan object under gravity. Both the kinetic energy\nof the object and its potential energy change\ncontinuously with time, but the sum remains\nfixed. If the object is released from rest, the initial\nTable 1.4  Progress in unification of different forces/domains in natureTable 1.3  Fundamental  forces  of  nature\nName Relative Range Operates among\nstrength\nGravitational force 10\u201339Infinite All objects in the universe\nWeak nuclear force 10\u201313Very short, Sub-nuclear Some elementary particles,\nsize ( \u223c10\u201316m) particularly electron and\nneutrino\nElectromagnetic force 10\u20132Infinite Charged particles\nStrong nuclear force 1 Short, nuclear Nucleons, heavier\nsize ( \u223c10\u201315m) elementary particles\n2020-21",

This law restricted for a conservative\nforce should not be confused with the general\nlaw of conservation of energy of an isolated\nsystem (which is the basis of the First Law of\nThermodynamics).\nThe concept of energy is central to physics\nand the expressions for energy can be written\nfor every physical system. When all forms of\nenergy e.g., heat, mechanical energy, electrical\nenergy etc., are counted, it turns out that energy\nis conserved. The general law of conservation of\nenergy is true for all forces and for any kind of\ntransformation between different forms of\nenergy. In the falling object example, if you\ninclude the effect of air resistance during the\nfall and see the situation after the object hits\nthe ground and stays there, the total\nmechanical energy is obviously not conserved.\nThe general law of energy conservation, however,\nis still applicable.  The initial potential energy\nof the stone gets transformed into other forms\nof energy : heat and sound. (Ultimately, sound\nafter it is absorbed becomes heat.) The total\nenergy of the system (ston e plus the\nsurroundings) remains unchanged.\nThe law of conservation of energy is thought\nto be valid across all domains of nature, from\nthe microscopic to the macroscopic. It is\nroutinely applied in the analysis of atomic,\nnuclear and elementary particle processes.  Atthe other end, all kinds of violent phenomena\noccur in the universe all the time.  Yet the total\nenergy of the universe (the most ideal isolated\nsystem possibl e!) is believed to remain\nunchanged.\nUntil the advent of Einstein\u2019s theory of\nrelativity, the law of conservation of mass was\nregarded as another basic conservation law of\nnature, since matter was thought to be\nindestructible. It was (and still is) an important\nprinciple used, for example, in the analysis of\nchemical reactions. A chemical reaction is\nbasically a rearrangement of atoms among\ndifferent molecules.  If the total binding energy\nof the reacting molecules is less than the total\nbinding energy of the product molecules, the\ndifference appears as heat and the reaction is\nexothermic.  The opposite is true for energy\nabsorbing (endothermic) reactions.  However,\nsince the atoms are merely rearranged but not\ndestroyed, the total mass of the reactants is the\nsame as the total mass of the products in a\nchemical reaction. The changes in the binding\nenergy are too small to be measured as changes\nin mass.\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s theory, mass m is\nequivalent to energy E given by the relation\nE = mc2, where c is speed of light in vacuum.\nIn a nuclear process mass gets converted to\nenergy (or vice-versa). This is the energy which\nis released in a nuclear power generation and\nnuclear explosions.\nSir C.V. Raman (1888-1970)\nChandrashekhara Venkata Raman  was born on 07 Nov 1888 in Thiruvanaikkaval.\nHe finished his schooling by the age of eleven. He graduated from Presidency\nCollege, Madras. After finishing his education he joined financial services of the\nIndian Government.\nWhile in Kolkata, he started working on his area of interest at Indian Asso-\nciation for Cultivation of Science founded  by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sirkar, during his\nevening hours. His area of interest included vibrations, variety of musical instru-\nments, ultrasonics, diffraction and so on.\nIn 1917 he was offered Professorship at Calcutta University. In 1924 he was\nelected \u2018Fellow\u2019 of the Royal Society of London and received Nobel prize in Physics\nin 1930 for his discovery, now known as Raman Effect.\nThe Raman Effect  deals with scattering of light by molecules of a medium\nwhen they are excited to vibrational energy levels. This work opened totally new\navenues for research for years to come.\nHe spent his later years at Bangalore, first at Indian Institute of Science and then at Raman Re-\nsearch Institute. His work has inspired generation of young students.\n2020-21",

The total\nlinear momentum and the total angular\nmomentum (both vectors) of an isolated system\nare also conserved quantities.  These laws can\nbe derived from Newton\u2019s laws of motion in\nmechanics.  But their validity goes beyond\nmechanics.  They are the basic conservation\nlaws of nature in all domains, even in those\nwhere Newton\u2019s laws may not be valid.\nBesides their great simplicity and generality,\nthe conservation laws of nature are very useful\nin practice too.  It often happens that we cannot\nsolve the full dynamics of a complex problem\ninvolving different particles and forces. The\nconservation laws can still provide useful\nresults.  For example, we may not know the\ncomplicated forces that act during a collision\nof two automobiles; yet momentum\nconservation law enables us to bypass the\ncomplications and predict or rule out possible\noutcomes of the collision. In nuclear and\nelementary particle phenomena also, the\nconservatio n laws are important tools of\nanalysis.  Indeed, using the conservation laws\nof energy and momentum for \u03b2-decay, Wolfgang\nPauli (190 0-1958) correctly predicted in 1931\nthe existence of a new particle (now called\nneutrino) emitted in \u03b2-decay along with the\nelectron.\nConservation laws have a deep connection\nwith symmetries of nature that you will explore\nin more advanced courses in physics.  For\nexample, an important observation is that the\nlaws of nature do not change with time!  If you\nperform an experiment in your laboratory today\nand repeat the same experiment (on the same\nobjects under identical conditions) after a year,\nthe results are bound to be the same.  It turns\nout that this symmetry of nature with respect to\ntranslation (i.e. displacement) in time is\nequivalent to the law of conservation of energy.\nLikewise, space is homogeneous and there is no\n(intrinsically) preferred location in the universe.\nTo put it more clearly, the laws of nature are the\nsame everywhere in the universe.  (Caution : the\nphenomena may differ from place to plac ebecause of differing conditions at different\nlocations. For example, the acceleration due to\ngravity at the moon is  one-sixth that at the earth,\nbut the law of gravitation  is the same both on\nthe moon and the earth.)  This symmetry of the\nlaws of nature with respect to translation in\nspace gives rise to conservation of linear\nmomentum.  In the same way isotropy of space\n(no intrinsically preferred direction in space)\nunderlies the law of conservation of angular\nmomentum *. The conservation laws of charge and\nother attributes of elementary particles can also\nbe related to certain abstract symmetries.\nSymmetries of space and time and other abstract\nsymmetries play a central role in modern theories\nof fundamental forces in nature.\n*See Chapter 7Conservation laws in physics\nConservation of energy, momentum, angular\nmomentum, charge, etc are considered to be\nfundamental laws in physics. At this moment,\nthere are many such conservation laws. Apart from\nthe above four, there are others which mostly deal\nwith quantities which have been introduced in\nnuclear and particle physics. Some of the\nconserved quantities are called spin, baryon\nnumber, strangeness, hypercharge, etc, but you\nneed not worry about them.\nA conservation law is a hypothesis, based on\nobservations and experiments. It is important to\nremember that a conservation law cannot be\nproved. It can be verified, or disproved, by\nexperiments. An experiment whose result is  in\nconformity with the law verifies or substantiates\nthe law; it does not prove the law. On the other\nhand, a single experiment whose result goes\nagainst the law is enough to disprove it.\nIt would be wrong to ask somebody to prove\nthe law of conservation of energy. This law is an\noutcome of our experience over several centuries,\nand it has been found to be valid in all\nexperiments, in mechanics, thermodynamics,\nelectromagnetism, optics, atomic and nuclear\nphysics, or any other area.\nSome students feel that they can prove the\nconservation of mechanical energy from a body\nfalling under gravity, by adding the kinetic and\npotential energies at a point and showing that it\nturns out to be constant. As pointed out above,\nthis is only a verification of the law, not its proof.\n2020-21",

The basic laws of physics are universal and apply in widely different\ncontexts and conditions.\n2.The scope of physics is wide, covering a tremendous range of magnitude of physical\nquantities.\n3.Physics and technology are related to each other.  Sometimes technology gives rise to\nnew physics; at other times physics generates new technology.  Both have direct impact\non society.\n4.There are four fundamental forces in nature that govern the diverse phenomena of the\nmacroscopic and the microscopic world. These are the \u2018gravitational force\u2019, the\n\u2018electromagnetic force\u2019, the \u2018strong nuclear force\u2019, and the \u2018weak nuclear force\u2019.  Unification\nof different forces/domains in nature is a basic quest in physics.\n5.The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved\nquantities. Some of the general conservation laws in nature include the laws of\nconservation of mass, energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, parity,\netc.  Some conservation laws are true for one fundamental force but not for the other.\n6.Conservation laws have a deep connection with symmetries of nature.  Symmetries of\nspace and time, and other types of symmetries play a central role in modern theories of\nfundamental forces in nature.\nEXERCISES\nNote for the student\nThe exercises given here are meant to enhance your awareness about the issues surrounding\nscience, technology and society and to encourage you to think and formulate your views\nabout them.  The questions may not have clear-cut \u2018objective\u2019 answers.\nNote for the teacher\nThe exercises given here are not  for the purpose of a formal examination.\n1.1 Some of the most profound statements on the nature of science have come from\nAlbert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time.

How will you refute his argumen t?\n1.6 The shells of crabs found around a particular coastal location in Japan seem mostly\nto resemble the legendary face of a Samurai.  Given below are two explanations of this\nobserved fact.  Which of these strikes you as a scientific explanation ?\n(a) A tragic sea accident several centuries ago drowned a young Samurai.

Demolish this view using scientific arguments, and\nby quoting examples of great women in science and other spheres; and persuade yourself\nand others that, given equal opportunity, women are on par with men.\n1.14 \u201cIt is more important to have beauty in the equations of physics than to have them\nagree with experiments\u201d. The great British physicist P. A. M. Dirac held this view.\nCriticize this statement.

The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or\nbase quantities are called fundamental  or base units . The\nunits of all other physical quantities can be expressed as\ncombinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the\nderived quantities are called derived units . A complete set\nof these units, both the base units and derived units, is\nknown as the system of units .\n2.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS\nIn earlier time scientists of different countries were using\ndifferent systems of units for measurement. Three such\nsystems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS\nsystem were in use extensively till recently.\nThe base units for length, mass and time in these systems\nwere as follows :\n\u2022In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second\nrespectively.\n\u2022In FPS system they were foot, pound and second\nrespectively.\n\u2022In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second\nrespectively.\nThe system of units which is at present internationally\naccepted for measurement is the Syst\u00e8me Internationale\nd\u2019 Unites  (French for International System of Units),\nabbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,\nunits and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau\nInternational des Poids et measures (The International\nBureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were\nrecently revised by the General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures in November 2018.

One mole\nsubstance contains exactly 6.02214076\u00d71023 elementary entities. This number is the\nfixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the\nunit mol\u20131 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,\nsymbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary\nentities.

For example, a\nmetre scale is used for lengths from 10\u20133 m to 102\nm.  A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an\naccuracy of 10\u20134 m.  A screw gauge and a\nspherometer c an be used to measure lengths as\nless as  to 10\u20135 m. To measure lengths beyond these\nranges, we make use of some special indirect\nmethods.2.3.1  Measurement of Large Distances\nLarge distances such as the distance of a planet\nor a star from the earth cannot be measured\ndirectly with a metre scale. An important method\nin such cases is the parallax method .\nWhen you hold a pencil in front of you against\nsome specific point on the  background (a wall)\nand look at the pencil first through your left eye\nA (closing the right eye) and then look at the\npencil through your right eye B  (closing the left\neye), you would notice that the position of the\npencil seems to change with respect to the point\non the wall.  This is called parallax .  The\ndistance between the two points of observation\nis called the basis . In this example, the basis is\nthe distance between the eyes.\nTo measure the distance D of a far away\nplanet S by the parallax method, we observe it\nfrom two different positions (observatories) A and\nB on the  Earth,  separated  by distance AB = b\nat the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2.  We\nmeasure the angle between the two directions\nalong which the planet is viewed at these two\npoints. The \u2220ASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by\nsymbol \u03b8 is called the parallax angle  or\nparallactic angle .\nAs the planet is very far away,  1,b\nD<<  and\ntherefore, \u03b8 is very small.  Then we\napproximately take AB as an arc of length b of a\ncircle with centre at S and the distance D as\n2020-21",

We cannot use a screw gauge\nor similar instruments. Even a microscope has\ncertain limitations.  An optical microscope uses\nvisible light to \u2018look\u2019 at the system under\ninvestigation.  As light has wave like features,\nthe resolution to which an optical microscope\ncan be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed\nexplanation can be found in the Class XII\nPhysics textbook). For visible light the range of\nwavelengths  is from about 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5\n(1 angstrom = 1 \u00c5 = 10-10 m). Hence an optical\nmicroscope cannot resolve particles with sizes\nsmaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can\nuse an electron beam.  Electron beams can be\nfocussed by properly designed electric and\nmagnetic fields. The resolution of such an\nelectron microscope is limited finally by the fact\nthat electrons can also behave as waves ! (You\nwill learn more about this in class XII). The\nwavelength of an electron can be as small as a\nfraction of an angstrom.  Such electron\nmicroscopes with a resolution of 0.6 \u00c5 have been\nbuilt. They can almost resolve atoms and\nmolecules in a material. In recent times,\ntunnelling microscopy has been developed in\nwhich again the limit of resolution is better than\nan angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes\nof molecules.\nA simple method for estimating the molecular\nsize of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a\nsoapy liquid with large molecular size of the\norder of 10\u20139 m.\nThe idea is to first form mono-molecular layer\nof oleic acid on water surface.\nWe dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to\nmake a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using\nalcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is\nequal to 1\n20 203\n\u00d7\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7cm of oleic acid/cm3 of\nsolution . Next we lightly sprinkle some\nlycopodium powder on the surface of water in a\nlarge trough and we put one drop of this solution\nin the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a\nthin, large and roughly circular film of molecular\nthickness on water surface. Then, we q uickly\nmeasure the diameter of the thin film to get its\narea A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in\nthe water. Initially, we determine the\napproximate volume of each drop ( V cm3).\nVolume of n drops of solution\n                             = nV cm3\nAmount of oleic acid in this solution\n                             = nV 1\n20 20\u00d7\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 cm3\nThis solution of oleic acid spreads very fast\non the surface of water and forms a very thin\nlayer of thickness t.  If this spreads to form a\nfilm of area A cm2, then the thickness of the\nfilm\nt=Volume of the film\nArea of th e film\nor, cm20 20 nVtA=\u00d7(2.3)\nIf we assume that the film has mono-molecular\nthickness, then this becomes the size or diameter\nof a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this\nthickness comes out to be of the order of 10\u20139 m.\nExample 2.5   If the size of a nucleus (in\nthe range of 10\u201315 to 10\u201314 m) is scaled up\nto the tip of a sharp pin, what roughly is\nthe size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin\nto be in the range 10\u20135m to 10\u20134m.\nAnswer   The size of a nucleus is in the range of\n10\u201315 m and 10\u201314 m.  The tip of a sharp pin is\ntaken to be in the range of 10\u20135 m and 10\u20134 m.\nThus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An\natom roughly of size 10\u201310 m will be scaled up to a\nsize of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small\nin size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre\nof a sphere of radius about a metre long. /triangleleft\n2020-21",

These may\nvary from the size of the order of 10\u201314 m of the\ntiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order\nof 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe.\nTable 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths\nand sizes of some of these objects.\nWe also use certain special length units for\nshort and large lengths. These are\n1 fermi = 1 f = 10\u201315 m\n1 angstrom = 1 \u00c5 = 10\u201310 m\n1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance\n    of the Sun from the Earth)\n= 1.496 \u00d7 1011 m\n1 light year = 1 ly = 9.46 \u00d7 1015 m (distance\n   that light travels with velocity of\n   3 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131 in 1 year)\n1 parsec = 3.08 \u00d7 1016 m (Parsec is the\ndistance at which average radius of earth\u2019s orbit\nsubtends an angle of 1 arc second)\n2.4  MEASUREMENT OF MASS\nMass is a basic property of matter.  It does not\ndepend on the temperature, pressure or location\nof the object in space. The SI unit of mass is\nkilogram (kg). It is defined by taking the fixed\nnumerical value of the Plank Constant h to be\n6.62607015\u00d710\u201334 when expressed in the unit of\nJs which is equal to kg m2s\u20131, where the\nmetre and the second are defined is terms of C\nand \u2206\u03bdcs.While dealing with atoms and molecules, the\nkilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case,\nthere is an important standard unit of mass,\ncalled the unified atomic mass unit (u), which\nhas been established for expressing the mass\nof atoms as\n1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u\n    =(1/12) of the mass of an atom of  carbon -12\nisotope ()612C including the mass  of electrons\n    =1.66 \u00d7 10\u201327  kg\nMass of commonly available objects can be\ndetermined by a common balance like the one\nused in a grocery shop. Large masses in the\nuniverse like planets, stars, etc., based on\nNewton\u2019s law of gravitation can be measured by\nusing gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For\nmeasurement of small masses of atomic/sub-\natomic particles etc., we make use of mass\nspectrograph in which radius of the trajectory\nis proportional to the mass of a charged particle\nmoving in uniform  electric and magnetic field.\n2.4.1  Range of  Masses\nThe masses of the objects, we come across in\nthe universe, vary over a very wide range.  These\nmay vary from tiny  mass of the order of 10-30 kg\nof an electron to the huge mass of about 1055 kg\nof the known universe.

This is the basis of the caesium\nclock , sometimes called atomic clock , used in\nthe national standards. Such standards are\navailable in many laboratories. In the caesium\natomic clock, the second is taken as the time\nneeded for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the\nradiation corresponding to the transition\nbetween the two hyperfine levels of the ground\nstate of caesium-133 atom. The vibrations of the\ncaesium atom regulate the rate of this caesium\natomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance\nwheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the\nvibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a\nquartz wristwatch.\nThe caesium atomic clocks are very accurate.\nIn principle they provide portable standard.  The\nnational standard of time interval \u2018second\u2019 as\nwell as the frequency is maintained through four\ncesium atomic clocks.  A caesium atomic clock\nis used at the National Physical Laboratory\n(NPL), New Delhi to  maintain the Indian\nstandard of time.\nIn our country, the NPL has the responsibility\nof maintenance and improvement of physical\nstandards, including that of time, frequency, etc.\nNote that the Indian Standar d Time (IST) is\nlinked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient\ncaesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they\nimpart the uncertainty in time realisation as\u00b1 1 \u00d7 10\u201315, i.e. 1 part in 1015.  This implies that\nthe uncertainty gained over time by such a\ndevice is less than 1 part in 1015; they lose or\ngain no mor e than 32 \u00b5s in one year . In view of\nthe tremendous accuracy in time measurement,\nthe SI unit of length has been expressed in terms\nthe path length light travels in certain interval\nof time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1).\nThe time interval of events that we come\nacross in the universe vary over a very wide\nrange. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of\nsome typical time intervals.\nYou may notice that ther e is an inter esting\ncoincidence between the numbers appearing\nin Tables 2. 3 and 2. 5. Note that the ratio of the\nlongest and shortest lengths of objects in our\nuniverse is about 1041. Interestingly enough,\nthe ratio of the longest and shortest time\nintervals associated with the events and objects\nin our universe is also about 1041. This number ,\n1041 comes up again in Table 2. 4, which lists\ntypical masses of objects. The ratio of the\nlargest and smallest masses of the objects in\nour universe is about (1041)2. Is this a curious\ncoincidence between these large numbers\npurely accidental  ?\n2.6ACCURACY, PRECISION OF  INSTRUMENTS\nAND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT\nMeasurement is the foundation of all\nexperimental science and technology. The result\nof every measurement by any measuring\ninstrument contains some uncertainty. This\nuncertainty is called error . Every calculated\nquantity which is based on measured values,\nalso has an err or. We shall distinguish between\ntwo terms: accuracy  and precision . The\naccuracy of a measurement is a measure of how\nclose the measured value is to the true value of\nthe quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution\nor limit the quantity is measured.\nThe accuracy in measurement may depend on\nseveral factors, including the limit or the resolution\nof the measuring instrument. For example, suppose\nthe true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.\nIn one experiment, using a measuring instrument\nof resolution 0.1 cm, the measured value is found to\nbe 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a\nmeasuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm,\nthe length is determined to be 3.38 cm.

Thus every measurement is\napproximate due to errors in measurement. In\ngeneral, the errors in measurement can be\nbroadly classified as (a) systematic errors and\n(b) random errors.\nSystematic errors\nThe systematic errors are those errors that\ntend to be in one direction, either positive or\nnegative. Some of the sources of systematic\nerrors are :\n(a)Instrumental errors  that arise from the\nerrors due to imperfect design or calibration\nof the measuring instrument, zero error in\nthe i nstrument, etc. For example, the\ntemperature graduations of a thermometer\nmay be inadequately calibrated (it may read\n104 \u00b0C at the boiling point of water at STP\nwhereas it should read 100 \u00b0C); in a vernier\ncallipers the zero mark of vernier scale may\nnot coincide with the zero mark of the main\nscale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may\nbe worn off at one end.\n(b)Imperfection in experimental technique\nor procedure  To determine the temperatureof a human body, a thermometer placed\nunder the armpit will always give a\ntemperature lower than the actual value of\nthe body temperature. Other external\nconditions (such as changes in temperature,\nhumidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the\nexperiment may systematically affect the\nmeasurement.\n(c)Personal errors that arise due to an\nindividual\u2019s bias, lack of proper setting of\nthe apparatus or individual\u2019s carelessness\nin taking observations without observing\nproper precautions, etc. For example, if you,\nby habit, always hold your head a bit too far\nto the right while reading the position of a\nneedle on the scale, you will introduce an\nerror due to parallax.\nSystematic errors can be minimised by\nimproving experimental techniques, selecting\nbetter instruments and removing personal bias\nas far as possible. For a given set-up, these\nerrors may be estimated to a certain extent and\nthe necessary corrections may be applied to the\nreadings.\nRandom errors\nThe random errors  are those errors, which occur\nirregularly and hence are random with respectTable 2.5   Range and order of time intervals\n2020-21",

These can arise due to random\nand unpredictable fluctuations in experimental\nconditions (e.g. unpredictable fluctuations in\ntemperature, voltage supply, mechanical\nvibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal\n(unbiased) errors by the observer taking\nreadings, etc. For example, when the same\nperson repeats the same observation, it is very\nlikely that he may get different readings\neverytime.\nLeast count error\nThe smallest value that can be measured by the\nmeasuring instrument is called its least count .\nAll the readings or measured values are good only\nup to this value.\nThe least count error  is the error\nassociated with the resolution of the instrument.\nFor example, a vernier callipers has the least\ncount as 0.0 1cm; a spherometer may have a\nleast count of 0.001 cm. Least count error\nbelongs to the category of random errors but\nwithin a limited size; it occurs with both\nsystematic and random errors. If we use a metre\nscale for measurement of length, it may have\ngraduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or\ninterval.\nUsing instruments of higher precision,\nimproving experimental techniques, etc., we can\nreduce the least count error. Repeating the\nobservations several times and taking the\narithmetic mean of all the observations, the\nmean value would be very close to the true value\nof the measured quantity.\n2.6.1 Absolute Error, Relative Error and\nPercentage Error\n(a) Suppose the values obtained in several\nmeasurements are a1, a2, a3...., an.  The\narithmetic mean of these values is taken as\nthe best possible value of the quantity under\nthe given conditions of measurement as :\namean = (a1+a2+a3+...+an ) / n (2.4)\nor,\na a / nmean i\ni 1n\n=\n=\u2211 (2.5)\nThis is because, as explained earlier, it is\nreasonable to suppose that individual\nmeasurements are as likely to overestimateas to underestimate the true value of the\nquantity.\nThe magnitude of the difference\nbetween the individual measurement and\nthe true value of the quantity is called the\nabsolute error of the measurement . This\nis denoted by |\u2206a |. In absence of any other\nmethod of knowing true value, we considered\narithmatic mean as the true value.  Then the\nerrors in the individual measurement values\nfrom the true value, are\n\u2206a1  = a1 \u2013 amean,\n\u2206a2  = a2 \u2013 amean,\n....      ....      ....\n....      ....      ....\n\u2206a n = an \u2013 amean\nThe \u2206a calculated above may be positive in\ncertain cases and negative in some other\ncases. But absolute error |\u2206a| will always\nbe positive.\n(b)The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors\nis taken as the final or mean absolute error\nof the value of the physical quantity a. It is\nrepresented by \u2206amean.\nThus,\n\u2206amean = (| \u2206a1|+|\u2206a2 |+| \u2206a3|+...+ | \u2206an|)/n\n(2.6)\n=\n=\u2211\ni 1n\n|\u2206ai|/n (2.7)\nIf we do a single measurement, the value we\nget may be in the range amean \u00b1  \u2206amean\ni.e.      a = amean \u00b1  \u2206amean\nor,\n     amean \u2013 \u2206amean \u2264 a  \u2264 amean + \u2206amean\n(2.8)\nThis implies that any measurement of the\nphysical quantity a is likely to lie between\n(amean+ \u2206amean)  and  (amean\u2212 \u2206amean).\n(c)Instead of the absolute error, we often use\nthe relative error  or the percentage error\n(\u03b4a).  The relative error is the ratio of the\nmean absolute error  \u2206 \u2206\u2206 \u2206\u2206amean to the mean\nvalue  amean of the quantity measured .\n2020-21",

The average reading of clock 1\nis much closer to the standard time than the\naverage reading of clock 2.  The important point\nis that a clock\u2019s zero error is not as significant\nfor precision work as its variation, because a\n\u2018zero-error\u2019 can always be easily corrected.\nHence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1.   /triangleleft\nExample 2.7  We measure the period of\noscillation of a simple pendulum.  In\nsuccessive measurements, the readings\nturn out to be 2.63 s, 2.56 s, 2.42 s, 2.71s\nand 2.80 s.

As the arithmetic\nmean of all the absolute errors is 0.11 s, there\nis already an error in the tenth of a second.\nHence there is no point in giving the period to a\nhundredth.

If we have errors\nin the measurement of mass and of the sizes or\ndimensions, we must know what the error will\nbe in the density of the substance. To make such\nestimates, we should learn how errors combine\nin various mathematical operations. For this,\nwe use the following procedure.(a)  Error of a sum or a difference\nSuppose two physical quantities A and B have\nmeasured values A \u00b1 \u2206A, B \u00b1 \u2206B respectively\nwhere \u2206A and \u2206B are their absolute errors. We\nwish to find the error \u2206Z in the sum\nZ = A + B.\nWe have by addition, Z \u00b1 \u2206Z\n= (A \u00b1 \u2206A) + (B \u00b1 \u2206B).\nThe maximum possible error in Z\n\u2206Z = \u2206A + \u2206B\nFor the difference Z = A \u2013 B,  we have\n                    Z \u00b1 \u2206 Z =  (A \u00b1 \u2206A) \u2013 (B \u00b1 \u2206B)\n                                = ( A \u2013 B) \u00b1 \u2206A \u00b1 \u2206B\nor, \u00b1 \u2206Z =  \u00b1 \u2206A \u00b1 \u2206B\nThe maximum value of the error \u2206Z  is again\n\u2206A + \u2206B.\nHence the rule  : When two quantities are\nadded or subtracted, the absolute error in the\nfinal result is the sum of the absolute errors\nin the individual quantities.\nExample 2.8  The temperatures of two\nbodies measured by a thermometer are\nt1 = 20 0C \u00b1 0.5 0C and t2 = 50 0C \u00b1 0.5 0C.\nCalculate the temperature difference and\nthe error theirin.\nAnswer   t\u2032 = t2\u2013t1 = (50 0C\u00b10.5 0C)\u2013 (200C\u00b10.5 0C)\n t\u2032 = 30 0C \u00b1 1 0C /triangleleft\n(b)  Error of a product or a quotient\nSuppose  Z = AB and the measured values of A\nand B are A \u00b1 \u2206A and B \u00b1 \u2206B. Then\nZ \u00b1 \u2206Z = (A \u00b1 \u2206A)  (B \u00b1 \u2206B)\n                     = AB \u00b1 B \u2206A \u00b1 A \u2206B \u00b1 \u2206A \u2206B.\nDividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have,\n1\u00b1(\u2206Z/Z) = 1 \u00b1 ( \u2206A/A) \u00b1 (\u2206B/B) \u00b1 (\u2206A/A)(\u2206B/B).\nSince \u2206A and \u2206B are small, we shall ignore their\nproduct.\nHence the maximum relative error\n\u2206Z/ Z = (\u2206A/A) + ( \u2206B/B).\nYou can easily verify that this is true for division\nalso.\nHence the rule  : When two quantities are\nmultiplied or divided, the relative error in the\nresult is the sum of the relative errors in the\nmultipliers.How will you measure the length of a line?\nWhat a na\u00efve question, at this stage, you might\nsay! But what if it is not a straight line? Draw\na zigzag line in your copy, or on the blackboard.\nWell, not too difficult again. You might take a\nthread, place it along the line, open up the\nthread, and measure its length.\nNow imagine that you want to measure the\nlength of a national highway, a river, the railway\ntrack between two stations, or the boundary\nbetween two states or two nations. If you take\na string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it\nalong the line, shift its position every time, the\narithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses\non the project is not commensurate with the\noutcome. Moreover, errors are bound to occur\nin this enormous task. There is an interesting\nfact about this. France and Belgium share a\ncommon international boundary, whose length\nmentioned in the official documents of the two\ncountries differs substantially!\nGo one step beyond and imagine the\ncoastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers\nhave fairly mild bends as compared to a\ncoastline. Even so, all documents, including our\nschool books, contain information on the length\nof the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh,\nor the common boundary between two states,\netc. Railway tickets come with the distance\nbetween stations printed on them. We have\n\u2018milestones\u2019 all along the roads indicating the\ndistances to various towns. So, how is it done?\nOne has to decide how much error one can\ntolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you\nwant smaller errors, it will involve high\ntechnology and high costs. Suffice it to say that\nit requires fairly advanced level of physics,\nmathematics, engineering and technology. It\nbelongs to the areas of fractals, which has lately\nbecome popular in theoretical physics. Even\nthen one doesn\u2019t know how much to rely on\nthe figure that props up, as is clear from the\nstory of France and Belgium. Incidentally, this\nstory of the France-Belgium discrepancy\nappears on the first page of an advanced Physics\nbook on the subject of fractals and chaos!\n2020-21",

If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it would\ngive a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures indicate,\nas already mentioned, the precision of\nmeasurement which depends on the least count\nof the measuring instrument. A choice of\nchange of different units does not change the\nnumber of significant digits or figures in a\nmeasurement.  This important remark makes\nmost of the following observations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 \u00b5m.\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n\u2022All the non-zero digits are significant.\n\u2022All the zeros between two non-zero digits\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n\u2022If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant.  [In 0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n\u2022The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\u2022The trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has  two significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10).  In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a \u00d7 10b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a \u22645) and to 10\n(for 5< a\u226410). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude  of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28\u00d7107m) is of the order of 107m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06  \u00d710\u201310m) is of the order of\n10\u201310m, with the order of magnitude\n\u201310. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n 4.700 m = 4.700 \u00d7 102 cm\n        = 4.700 \u00d7 103 mm = 4.700 \u00d7 10\u20133 km\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures.

Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n\u2022For a number greater than 1, without any\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n\u2022For a number with a decimal, the trailing\nzero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\nexample in 2dr= or  s = 2 \u03c0r, the factor 2 is an\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\nor 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in tTn=, n is\nan exact number.\n2.7.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with\nSignificant Figures\nThe result of a calculation involving approximate\nmeasured values of quantities (i.e. values with\nlimited number of significant figures) must reflect\nthe uncertainties in the original measured values.\nIt cannot be more accurate than the original\nmeasured values themselves on which the result\nis based. In general, the final result should not\nhave more significant figures than the original\ndata from which it was  obtained. Thus, if mass of\nan object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four\nsignificant figures) and its volume is measured to\nbe 2.51 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic\ndivision, is 1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal\nplaces. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant\nto record the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. Thefollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result of\na calculation is shown with the precision that is\nconsistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three  significant figures.\nDensity4.237g\n2.51 cm1.69 g cm3-3= =\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3 \u00d7 108 m s-1 (one  significant figure) and one\nyear (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557  \u00d7 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47  \u00d7 1015 m\n(three  significant figures).\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least decimal\nplaces.\nFor example, the sum of th e numbers\n436.32  g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final resul t should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n0.307 m \u2013 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 \u00d7 10\u20133 m.\nNote that we should not use the rule (1)\napplicable for multiplication and division and\nwrite 664 g as the result in the example of\naddition  and 3.00  \u00d7 10\u20133 m in the example of\nsubtraction . They do not convey the precision\nof measurement properly. For addition and\nsubtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal\nplaces.\n2.7.2   Rounding off the Uncertain Digits\nThe result of computation with approximate\nnumbers, which contain more than one\nuncertain digit, should be rounded off.  The rules\nfor rounding off  numbers to the appropriate\nsignificant figures are obvious in most cases.  A\nnumber 2.74 6 rounded off to three significant\nfigures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would\nbe 2.74.  The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\n2020-21",

But what if the number is 2.74 5 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\nis raised by  1. Then, the number 2.74 5 rounded\noff to three significant figures becomes 2.74.  On\nthe other hand, the number 2.73 5 rounded off\nto three significant figures becomes 2.74 since\nthe preceding digit is odd.\nIn any involved or complex multi-step\ncalculation, you should retain, in intermediate\nsteps, one digit more than the significant digits\nand round off to proper significant figures at the\nend of the calculation.

All the physical quantities\nrepresented by derived units can be expressed\nin terms of some combination of seven\nfundamental or base quantities. We shall call\nthese base quantities as the seven dimensions\nof the physical world, which are denoted withsquare brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity . Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith \u2018 the dimensions of \u2019 the quantity.\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the\ndimensions of volume are [L] \u00d7 [L] \u00d7 [L] = [L]3 = [L3].\nAs the volume is independent of mass and time,\nit is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M\u00b0],\nzero dimension in time [T\u00b0] and three\ndimensions in length.\nSimilarly, force, as the product of mass and\nacceleration, can be expressed as\nForce   = mass \u00d7 acceleration\n= mass \u00d7 (length)/(time)2\nThe dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =\n[M L T\u20132]. Thus, the force has one dimension in\nmass, one dimension in length, and \u20132\ndimensions in time. The dimensions in all other\nbase quantities are zero.\nNote that in this type of representation, the\nmagnitudes are not considered. It is the quality\nof the type of the physical quantity that enters.\nThus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,\naverage velocity, final velocity, and speed are\nall equivalent in this context. Since all these\nquantities can be expressed as length/time,\ntheir dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T\u20131].\n2.9DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND\nDIMENSIONAL E QUATIONS\nThe expression which shows how and which of\nthe base quantities represent the dimensions\nof a physical quantity is called the dimensional\nformula  of the given physical quantity. For\nexample, the dimensional formula of the volume\nis [M\u00b0 L3 T\u00b0],  and  that of speed or velocity is\n[M\u00b0 L T-1]. Similarly, [M\u00b0 L T\u20132] is the dimensional\nformula of acceleration and [M L\u20133 T\u00b0] that of\nmass density.\nAn equation obtained by equating a physical\nquantity with its dimensional formula is called\nthe dimensional equation  of the physical\n2020-21",

For example, the dimensional\nequations of volume [ V],  speed [ v], force [ F] and\nmass density [ \u03c1] may be expressed as\n[V] = [M0 L3 T0]\n[v] = [M0 L T\u20131]\n[F] = [M L T\u20132]\n[\u03c1] = [M L\u20133 T0]\nThe dimensional equation can be obtained\nfrom the equation representing the relations\nbetween the physical quantities. The\ndimensional formulae of a large number and\nwide variety of physical quantities, derived from\nthe equations representing the relationships\namong other physical quantities and expressed\nin terms of base quantities are given in\nAppendix 9 for your guidance and ready\nreference.\n2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS\nAPPLICATIONS\nThe recognition of concepts of dimensions, which\nguide the description of physical behaviour is\nof basic importance as only those physical\nquantities can be added or subtracted which\nhave the same dimensions.  A thorough\nunderstanding of dimensional analysis helps us\nin deducing certain relations among different\nphysical quantities and checking the derivation,\naccuracy and dimensional consistency or\nhomogeneity of various mathematical\nexpressions.  When magnitudes of two or more\nphysical quantities are multiplied, their units\nshould be treated in the same manner as\nordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel\nidentical units in the numerator and\ndenominator.  The same is true for dimensions\nof a physical quantity.  Similarly, physical\nquantities represented by symbols on both sides\nof a mathematical equation must have the same\ndimensions.\n2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional\nConsistency of Equations\nThe magnitudes of physical quantities may be\nadded together or subtracted from one another\nonly if they have the same dimensions.  In other\nwords, we can add or subtract similar physical\nquantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to\nforce, or an electric current cannot be subtractedfrom the thermodynamic temperature. This\nsimple principle called the principle of\nhomogeneity of dimensions  in an equation is\nextremely useful in checking the correctness of\nan equation.  If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T\u20131].\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorrectness of the equation. However, the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions. The\narguments of special functions, such as the\ntrigonometric, logarithmic and exponential\nfunctions must be dimensionless. A pure\nnumber, ratio of similar physical quantities,\nsuch as angle as the ratio (length/length),\nrefractive index as the ratio (speed of light in\nvacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no\ndimensions.\nNow we can test the dimensional consistency\nor homogeneity of the equation\n()21/2  0 0 x x v  t a t= + +\nfor the distance x travelled by a particle or body\nin time t which starts from the position x0 with\nan initial velocity v0 at time t = 0 and has uniform\nacceleration a along the direction of motion.\nThe dimensions of each term may be written as\n                 [x] = [L]\n               [x0 ] = [L]\n             [v0 t] = [L T\u20131]  [T]\n                     = [L]\n       [(1/2) a t2] = [L T\u20132] [T2]\n                     = [L]\nAs each term on the right hand side of this\nequation has the same dimension, namely that\nof length, which is same as the dimension of\nleft hand side of the equation, hence this\nequation is a dimensionally correct equation.\nIt may be noted that a test of consistency of\ndimensions tells us no more and no less than a\n2020-21",

Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length,\nmass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and\nluminous intensity).\n2.Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n3.Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4.The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5.The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6.The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for\nmetre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7.Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n8.Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n9.In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n10.Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities.\nIn measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of\nmeasuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account.\n11.In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.\nRules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic\noperations with them, and \u2018rounding off \u2018 the uncertain digits must be followed.\n12.The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the\nnature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional\nconsistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A\ndimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation,\nbut a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.or, T = lkg\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained\nby the method of dimensions.

W e see leaves falling fr om tr ees and water flowing\ndown a dam.  Automobiles and planes carry people from one\nplace to the other . The earth r otates once every twenty-four\nhours and r evolves r ound the sun once in a year . The sun\nitself is in motion in the Milky W ay, which is again moving\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter , we shall\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. W e shall confine\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\nline, also known as rectilinear motion . For the case of\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a\nreasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations\nin real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can\nbe consider ed as point-like objects without much err or.\nIn Kinematics , we study ways to describe motion without\ngoing into the causes of motion.

Consider two cases\nof motion.  In the first case, the car moves from\nO to P.  Then the distance moved by the car is\nOP = +360 m. This distance is called the path\nlength  traversed by the car .   In the second\ncase, the car moves from O to P and then moves\nback from P to Q.   During this course of motion,\nthe path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m\n+ (+120 m) = + 480 m.  Path length is a scalar\nquantity \u2014 a quantity that has a magnitude\nonly and no direction (see Chapter 4).\nDisplacement\nIt is useful to define another quantity\ndisplacement   as  the  change  in position. Let\nx1 and x2 be the positions of an object at time t1and t2. Then its displacement, denoted by \u2206x, in\ntime \u2206t = ( t2 - t1), is given by the difference\nbetween the final and initial positions :\n                       \u2206x = x2 \u2013 x1(We use the Greek letter delta ( \u2206) to denote a\nchange in a quantity.)\nIf   x\n2 > x\n1, \u2206x is positive; and if x\n2 < x\n1,\n \u2206x is\nnegative.\nDisplacement has both magnitude and\ndirection. Such quantities are represented by\nvectors. You will read about vectors in the next\nchapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion\nalong a straight line (also called rectilinear\nmotion ) only. In one-dimensional motion, there\nare only two directions (backward and forward,\nupward and downward) in which an object can\nmove, and these two directions can easily be\nspecified by + and \u2013 signs. For example,\ndisplacement of the car in moving from O to P is :\n\u2206x = x\n2 \u2013 x\n1 = (+360 m) \u2013 0 m = +360 m\nThe displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and\nis directed in the positive x direction as indicated\nby the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the\ncar from P to Q is 240 m \u2013 360 m = \u2013 120 m. The\nFig. 3.1   x-axis, origin and positions of a car at different times.a rectangular coordinate system consisting of\nthree mutually perpenducular axes, labelled  X-,\nY-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these\nthree axes is called origin (O) and serves as the\nreference point . The coordinates ( x, y. z ) of an\nobject describe the position of the object with\nrespect to this coordinate system. To measure\ntime, we position a clock in this system. This\ncoordinate system along with a clock constitutes\na frame of reference .\nIf one or more coordinates of an object change\nwith time, we say that the object is in motion.\nOtherwise, the object is said to be at rest with\nrespect to this frame of reference.\nThe choice of a set of axes in a frame of\nreference depends upon the situation. For\nexample, for describing motion in one dimension,\nwe need only one axis. To describe motion in\ntwo/three dimensions, we need a set of two/\nthree axes.\nDescription of an event depends on the frame\nof reference chosen for the description. For\nexample, when you say that a car is moving on\na road, you are describing the car with respect\nto a frame of reference attached to you or to the\nground. But with respect to a frame of reference\nattached with a person sitting in the car, the\ncar is at rest.\nTo describe motion along a straight line, we\ncan choose an axis, sa y X-axis, s o that it\ncoincides with the path of the object. We then\nmeasure the position of the object with reference\nto a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown\nin Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken\nas positive and to the left of O, as negative.\nFollowing this convention, the position\ncoordinates of point P  and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360\nm and +240 m.

Thus, it is not necessary to use\nvector notation for discussing motion of objects\nin one-dimension.\nThe magnitude of displacement may or may\nnot be equal to the path length traversed by\nan object.   For example, for motion of the car\nfrom O to P, the path length is  +360 m and the\ndisplacement is +360 m. In this case, the\nmagnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to\nthe path length (360 m).

Then the\nbrakes are applied and the car stops at\nt = 20 s and x = 296 m. The position-time graph\nfor this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer\nto this graph in our discussion in the following\nsections.\n3.3  AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE\nSPEED\nWhen an object is in motion, its position\nchanges with time.  But how fast is the position\nchanging with time and in what direction?  To\ndescribe this, we define the quantity average\nvelocity . Average velocity is defined as the\nchange in position or displacement ( \u2206x) divided\nby the time intervals ( \u2206t), in which the\ndisplacement occurs :\n     vx x\nt tx\nt2 1\n2 1=\u2212\n\u2212=\u2206\n\u2206(3.1)\nwhere x2  and x1 are the positions of the object\nat time t2and  t1, respectively. Here the bar over\nthe symbol for velocity is a standard notation\nused to indicate an average quantity.  The SI\nunit for velocity is m/s or m s\u20131, although km h\u20131\nis used in many everyday applications.\nLike displacement, average velocity is also a\nvector quantity. But as explained earlier, for\nmotion in a straight line, the directional aspect\nof the vector can be taken care of by + and \u2013\nsigns and we do not have to use the vector\nnotation for velocity in this chapter.\nFig. 3.4 The average velocity is the slope of line P1P2.Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3. The\nportion of the x-t graph between t = 0 s and t = 8\ns is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4.  As seen\nfrom the plot, the average velocity of the car\nbetween time t = 5 s and t = 7 s is :\n(( (( )) ))\n(( (( ) ) ))1 \u2013\n1 21 2s m  8.7s  5 7m 0 10 4 27== ==\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212== ==\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212== ==. .\nt tx xv\nGeometrically, this is the slope of the straight\nline P1P2 connecting the initial position 1P to\nthe final position P2   as\n   shown in Fig. 3.4.\nThe average velocity can be positive or negative\ndepending upon the sign of the displacement. It\nis zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows\nthe x-t graphs for an object, moving with positive\nvelocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity\n(Fig. 3.5b)  and at rest (Fig. 3.5c).\nAverage velocity as defined above involves\nonly the displacement of the object. We have seen\nearlier that the magnitude of displacement may\nbe different from the actual path length. To\ndescribe the rate of motion over the actual path,\nwe introduce another quantity called average\nspeed .\nAverage speed   is defined as the total path\nlength travelled divided by the total time\ninterval during which the motion has taken\nplace :\nAverage speedTotal path length\nTotal time  interval =   (3.2)\nAverage speed has obviously the same unit\n(m s\u20131) as that of velocity.  But it does not tell us\nin what direction an object is moving.  Thus, it\nis always positive (in contrast to the average\nvelocity which can be positive or negative). If the\nmotion of an object is along a straight line and\nin the same direction , the magnitude of\ndisplacement is equal to the total path length.\nIn that case, the magnitude of average velocityFig. 3.5 Position-time graph for an object (a) moving\nwith positive velocity, (b) moving with\nnegative velocity, and (c) at rest .\n2020-21",

What are the average velocity\nand average speed of the car in going (a)\nfrom O to P ? and (b) from O to P and back\nto Q ?\nAnswer    (a)\n Average velocityDisplacement\nTime inter val =\n   1 + 360 m 20 m s18 sv\u2212= = +\n     Average speed  Path length\nTime inter val=\n                1 360 m = 20 m s18 s\u2212=\nThus, in this case the average speed is equal to\nthe magnitude of the average velocity.\n(b) In this case,\n( )240 m\n18 6.0  sDisplacement Average velocity =\nTime interval +=\n+\n                            -1=+10 ms\nOP + PQ Path lengthAverage speed = =Time interval t \u2206\n ( )-1 360+120  m= = 20 m s24 s\nThus, in this case the average speed is not equal\nto the magnitude of the average velocity. This\nhappens because the motion here involves\nchange in direction so that the path length is\ngreater than the magnitude of displacement.\nThis shows that speed is, in general, greater\nthan the magnitude of the velocity. /triangleleft\nIf the car in Example 3.1 moves from O  to P\nand comes back to O in the same time interval,\naverage speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity\nis zero !3.4  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED\nThe average velocity tells us how fast an object\nhas been moving over a given time interval but\ndoes not tell us how fast it moves at different\ninstants of time during that interval.  For this,\nwe define  instantaneous velocity  or simply\nvelocity v at an instant t.\nThe velocity at an instant is defined as the\nlimit of the average velocity as the time interval\n\u2206t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,\nv limx\nt=\nt  0 \u2206  \u2206\n\u2206 \u2192(3.3a)\n  =d\ndx\nt(3.3b)\nwhere the symbol lim\nt0 \u2206\u2192 stands for the operation\nof taking limit as  \u2206t/b2right0 of the quantity on its\nright. In the language of calculus, the quantity\non the right hand side of Eq. (3.3a) is the\ndifferential coefficient of x with respect to t and\nis denoted by  d\ndx\nt (see Appendix 3.1).  It is the\nrate of change of position with respect to time,\nat that instant.\nWe can use Eq. (3.3a) for obtaining the value\nof velocity at an instant either graphically  or\nnumerically . Suppose that we want to obtain\ngraphically the value of velocity at time  t = 4 s\n(point P) for the motion of the car represented\nin Fig. 3.3. The figure has been redrawn in\nFig.3.6 choosing different scales to facilitate the\nFig. 3.6 Determining velocity from position-time\ngraph.  Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the\ntangent to the graph at that instant .\n2020-21",

Then, by the definition of the average\nvelocity, the slope of line P1P2  ( Fig. 3.6) gives\nthe value of average velocity over the interval\n3 s to 5 s.  Now, we decrease the value of \u2206t from\n2 s to 1 s.  Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its\nslope gives the value of the average velocity over\nthe interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s.

The\nsixth column lists the difference \u2206x = x (t2) \u2013 x\n(t1) and the last column gives the ratio of \u2206x and\n\u2206t, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the\nvalue of \u2206t listed in the first column.\nWe see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease\nthe value of \u2206t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of\nthe average velocity approaches the limiting\nvalue 3.84 m s\u20131 which is the value of velocity at\nt = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of  d\ndx\nt at t = 4.0 s. In this\nmanner, we can calculate velocity at eachinstant for motion of the car shown in Fig. 3.3.\nFor this case, the variation of velocity with time\nis found to be as shown in Fig. 3.7.\nFig. 3.7 Velocity\u2013time graph corresponding to motion\nshown in Fig. 3.3 .\nThe graphical method for the determination\nof the instantaneous velocity is always not a\nconvenient method.

It is easier to calculate the value\nof velocity at different instants if we have data\nof positions at different instants or exact\nexpression for the position as a function of time.\nThen, we calculate \u2206x/\u2206t from the data for\ndecreasing the value of \u2206t and find the limiting\nvalue as we have done in Table 3.1 or use\ndifferential calculus for the given expression and\ncalculate d\ndx\nt at different instants as done in\nthe following example.\nTable 3.1  Limiting value of \u2206\n\u2206x\nt at t = 4 s\n2020-21",

Between\nperiod t =18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly\ndecreasing  and  during  the  period t = 0 s to     t\n= 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform\nmotion, velocity is the same as the average\nvelocity at all instants .\nInstantaneous speed  or simply speed  is the\nmagnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of\n+ 24.0 m s\u20131 and a velocity of \u2013 24.0 m s\u20131 \u2014 both\nhave an associated speed of 24.0 m s-1.  It should\nbe noted that though average speed over a finite\ninterval of time is greater or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity,\ninstantaneous speed at an instant is equal to\nthe magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at\nthat instant. Why so ?\n3.5  ACCELERATION\nThe velocity of an object, in general, changes\nduring its course of motion. How to describe this\nchange? Should it be described as the rate of\nchange in velocity with distance or with time  ?\nThis was a problem even in Galileo\u2019s time. It was\nfirst thought that this change could be described\nby the rate of change of velocity with distance.\nBut, through his studies of motion of freely falling\nobjects and motion of objects on an inclined\nplane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change\nof velocity with time is a constant of motion for\nall objects in free fall. On the other hand, the\nchange in velocity with distance is not constant\n\u2013 it decreases with the increasing distance of fall .This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate\nof change of velocity with time.\n The average acceleration a over a time\ninterval is defined as the change of velocity\ndivided by the time interval :\n2 1\n2 1\u2013\n\u2013v v va\nt t t\u2206= =\u2206(3.4)\nwhere v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities\nor simply velocities at time  t2 and t1 . It is the\naverage change of velocity per unit time. The SI\nunit of acceleration is m s\u20132 .\nOn a plot of velocity versus time, the average\nacceleration is the slope of the straight line\nconnecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)\nand ( v1, t1).

When the acceleration\nis uniform, obviously, it equals the average\nacceleration over that period.\nSince velocity is a quantity having both\nmagnitude and direction, a change in velocity\nmay involve either or both of these factors.\nAcceleration, therefore, may result from a\nchange in speed (magnitude), a change in\ndirection or changes in both.  Like velocity,\nacceleration can also be positive, negative or\nzero.  Position-time graphs for motion with\npositive, negative and zero acceleration are\nshown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.\nNote that the graph curves upward for positive\nacceleration; downward for negative\nacceleration and it is a straight line for zero\nacceleration.

While that train must be travelling faster\nthan you to be able to pass you, it does seem\nslower to you than it would be to someone\nstanding on the ground and watching both the\ntrains. In case both the trains have the same\nvelocity with respect to the ground, then to you\nthe other train would seem to be not moving at\nall.  To understand such observations, we now\nintroduce the concept of relative velocity.\nConsider two objects A  and B moving\nuniformly with average velocities vA and vB in\none dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless\notherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in\nthis chapter are measured with reference to the\nground). If xA (0) and xB (0) are positions of objects\nA and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions\nxA (t) and xB (t) at time t are given by:\nxA (t )  =  xA (0)  +  vA  t     (3.12a)\nxB (t)   =  xB (0)  +  vB t               (3.12b)\nThen, the displacement from object A to object\nB is given by\nxBA(t)  =  xB (t)  \u2013  xA (t)\n= [ xB (0) \u2013 xA (0) ] + ( vB \u2013 vA) t.     (3.13)\nEquation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us\nthat as seen from object A, object B has a\nvelocity vB \u2013 vA because the displacement from\nA to B changes steadily by the amount vB \u2013 vA in\neach unit of time. We say that the velocity of\nobject B relative to object A  is vB \u2013 vA :\nvBA  =  vB  \u2013 vA(3.14a)\nSimilarly, velocity of object A relative to object B\nis:\nvAB  =  vA \u2013 vB(3.14b)\nFig. 3.15    Measuring the reaction time.\nAnswer   The ruler drops under free fall.\nTherefore, vo = 0, and a = \u2013g = \u20139.8 m s\u20132.

The position of the\nobject can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in\na straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as\nnegative.\n2.Path length  is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object.\n3.Displacement  is the change in position :   \u2206x  =  x2 \u2013 x1.   Path length is greater or equal to\nthe magnitude of the displacement between the same points.\n4.An object is said to be in uniform motion  in a straight line if its displacement is \u00a0equal\nin equal intervals of time.  Otherwise, the motion is said to be non-uniform.\n5.Average velocity  is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the\ndisplacement occurs :\nvx\nt=\u2206\n\u2206\nOn an x-t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line\nconnecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval.\n6.Average Speed  is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time\ninterval.\nThe average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average\nvelocity over a given time interval.\n7.Instantaneous velocity  or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as\nthe time interval \u2206t becomes infinitesimally small :\nd\nd t 0 t 0x xv lim v limt t \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 \u2192\u2206= = =\u2206\nThe velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on\nposition-time graph at that instant.\n8.Average acceleration  is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which\nthe change occurs :\nvat\u2206=\u2206\n9.Instantaneous acceleration  is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time\ninterval \u2206t goes to zero :\nd\nd t 0 t 0v va lim a limt t \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 \u2192\u2206= = =\u2206\nThe acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time\ngraph at that instant of time.

    "content": "MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 55\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same\nas the magnitude of displacement.  The displacement depends only on the end points;\nthe path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path.  In one dimension,\nthe two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the\ncourse of motion.  In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of\ndisplacement.\n2.In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if\nthe path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n3.The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first\nspecify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity\nand acceleration.\n4.If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n5.The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle\u2019s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n6.The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero\nacceleration.  For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost\npoint but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to\ngravity.\n7.In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.11)], the various quantities are algebraic,\ni.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations\n(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different\nquantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.\n8.The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)) are\nexact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (3.11)) are true only\nfor motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant\nduring the course of motion.\nEXERCISES\n3.1 In which of the following examples of motion, can the body be considered\napproximately a point object:\n(a)a railway carriage moving without jerks between two stations.\n(b)a monkey sitting on top of a man cycling smoothly on a circular track.\n(c)a spinning cricket ball that turns sharply on hitting the ground.\n(d)a tumbling beaker that has slipped off the edge of a table.\n3.2 The position-time ( x-t) graphs for two children A and B returning from their school\nO to their homes P and Q respectively are shown in Fig. 3.19. Choose the correct\nentries in the brackets below ;\n(a)(A/B) lives closer to the school than (B/A)\n(b)(A/B) starts from the school earlier than (B/A)\n(c)(A/B) walks faster than (B/A)\n(d)A and B reach home at the (same/different) time\n(e)(A/B) overtakes (B/A) on the road (once/twice).\n2020-21",

Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall introduce\nthis concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities\ninvolved in motion.\nSuppose we have a quantity y whose value depends upon a single variable x, and is expressed\nby an equation defining y as some specific function of x.  This is represented as:\n y = f (x) (1)\nThis relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function y = f (x) regarding y and x as\nCartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a).\n                             (a)      (b)\nFig.  3.30\nConsider the point P  on the curve y = f (x) whose coordinates are ( x, y) and another point Q\nwhere coordinates are ( x + \u2206 x, y + \u2206y).  The slope of the line joining P  and Q is given by:\n( )\nxy y y\nxytan\u2206\u2212 \u2206 +=\u2206\u2206=\u03b8 (2)\nSuppose now that the point Q  moves along the curve towards P.  In this process, \u2206y and \u2206x\ndecrease and approach zero; though their ratio \u2206\n\u2206y\nx  will not necessarily vanish.  What happens\nto the line PQ as \u2206y\u2192 0, \u2206x\u2192 0. You can see that this line becomes a  tangent to the curve at\npoint P  as shown in Fig. 3.30(b).  This means that tan \u03b8  approaches the slope of  the tangent at\nP, denoted by m:\n                                \nx 0 0( )lim li m\nxy y y ymx x \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 \u2192\u2206 + \u2206 \u2212= =\u2206 \u2206(3)\nThe limit of the ratio \u2206y/\u2206x as  \u2206x approaches zero is called the derivative of y with respect to x\nand is written as dy/d x. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the\npoint (x, y).\nSince y = f (x) and y + \u2206y = f (x + \u2206x), we can write the definition of the derivative as:\n                    \uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ee\n\u2206\u2206 +=\u2206\u2206= =\n\u2192 \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 xx f x x f   xy ) (\nx) ( \u2013 ) (lim limdxd\ndxdy\n0 0 xx f\nGiven below are some elementary formulae for derivatives of functions.  In these u (x) and v (x)\nrepresent arbitrary functions of x, and a and b  denote constant quantities that are independent\nof x.  Derivatives of some common functions are also listed .\n2020-21",

The formulae for areas of simple geometrical figures are\nalso known to you.  For example, the area of a rectangle is length times breadth and that of a\ntriangle is half of the product of base and height.  But how to deal with the problem of determination\nof area of an irregular figure?  The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with\nsuch problems.\nLet us take a concrete example.  Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion\nalong x - axis from x = a to x = b.  The problem is to determine the work done ( W) by the force on the\nparticle during the motion.  This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.\nFigure 3.31 shows the variation of  F(x)  with x.  If the force were constant, work  would  be  simply\nthe area F (b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.31(i).  But in the general case, force is varying .\nFig. 3.31\n2020-21",

    "content": "CHAPTER  FOUR\nMOTION IN A PLANE\n4.1  INTRODUCTION\nIn the last chapter we developed the concepts of position,\ndisplacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to\ndescribe the motion of an object along a straight line. W e\nfound that the directional aspect of these quantities can be\ntaken care of by + and \u2013 signs, as in one dimension only two\ndirections are possible. But in order to describe motion of an\nobject in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions\n(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-\nmentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary\nto learn the language of vectors. What is a vecto r? How to\nadd, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of\nmultiplying a vector by a r eal number ? W e shall lear n this\nto enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and\nacceleration in a plane. W e then discuss motion of an object\nin a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall\ndiscuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail\nthe projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of\nmotion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.\nWe shall discuss unifor m cir cular motion in some detail.\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a\nplane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.\n4.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS\nIn physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or\nvectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is\nassociated with a vector but not with a scalar .  A scalar\nquantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified\ncompletely by a single number , along with the pr oper\nunit. Examples are : the distance between two points,\nmass of an object, the temperature of a body and the\ntime at which a certain  event happened.  The rules for\ncombining scalars are the  rules of ordinary algebra.\nScalars can be added,  subtracted, multiplied and divided4.1 Introduction\n4.2 Scalars and vectors\n4.3 Multiplication of vectors by\nreal numbers\n4.4 Addition and subtraction of\nvectors \u2014 graphical method\n4.5 Resolution of vectors\n4.6 Vector addition \u2014 analytical\nmethod\n4.7 Motion in a plane\n4.8 Motion in a plane with\nconstant acceleration\n4.9 Relative velocity in two\ndimensions\n4.10 Projectile motion\n4.11 Uniform circular motion\nSummary\nPoints to ponder\nExercises\nAdditional exercises\n2020-21",

For example,\nif the length and breadth of a rectangle are\n1.0 m and 0.5 m  respectively , then its\nperimeter is the sum of the lengths of the\nfour sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =\n3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar\nand the perimeter is also a scalar. Take\nanother example: the maximum and\nminimum temperatures on a particular day\nare 35.6 \u00b0C and 24.2 \u00b0C  respectively .  Then,\nthe difference between the two temperatures\nis 11.4 \u00b0C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube\nof aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of\n2.7 kg, then its volume is 10\u20133 m3 (a scalar)\nand its density is 2.7 \u00d7103 kg m\u20133 (a scalar).\nA vector  quantity is a quantity that has both\na magnitude and a direction and obeys the\ntriangle law of addition  or equivalently the\nparallelogram law of addition . So, a vector is\nspecified by giving its magnitude by a number\nand its direction. Some physical quantities that\nare represented by vectors are displacement,\nvelocity, acceleration and force.\nTo represent a vector, we use a bold face type\nin this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be\nrepresented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is\ndifficult to produce, when written by hand, a\nvector is often represented by an arrow placed\nover a letter, say rv. Thus, both v and rv\nrepresent the velocity vector. The magnitude of\na vector is often called its absolute value,\nindicated by | v| = v.  Thus, a vector is\nrepresented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...\nx, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light\nface A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y .\n4.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors\nTo describe the posi tion of an object moving in\na plane, we  need to choose a convenient point,\nsay O as origin. Let P and P \u2032 be the positions of\nthe object at time t and t\u2032, respectively [Fig. 4.1(a)].\nWe join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is\nthe position vector of the object at tim e t.  An\narrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is\nrepresented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P \u2032 isrepresented by another position vector, OP\u2032\ndenoted by r\u2032. The length of the vector r\nrepresents the magnitude of the vector and its\ndirection is the direction in which P lies as seen\nfrom O. If the object moves from P to P \u2032, the\nvector PP\u2032 (with tail at P and tip at P \u2032) is called\nthe displacement vector corresponding to\nmotion from point P (at time t) to point P \u2032 (at time t\u2032).\nFig. 4.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.\n(b) Displacement vector PQ and different\n     courses of motion.\nIt is important to note that displacement\nvector is the straight line joining the initial and\nfinal positions and does not depend on the actual\npath undertaken by the object between the two\npositions.  For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the\ninitial and final positions as P and Q, the\ndisplacement vector is the same PQ for different\npaths of journey, say PABC Q, PDQ, and PBEF Q.\nTherefore, the magnitude of displacement is\neither less or equal to the path length of an\nobject between two points . This fact was\nemphasised in the previous chapter also while\ndiscussing motion along a straight line.\n4.2.2  Equality of Vectors\nTwo vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and\nonly if, they have the same magnitude and the\nsame direction. **\nFigure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and\nB. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B\nparallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that\nof A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then , since  their\ntips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are\nsaid to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated\n*Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply\nand divide scalars of different units.\n**In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector\nunchanged. Such vectors are called f ree vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of\napplication of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.\n2020-21",

Then, the dimension of \u03bb A is the\nproduct of the dimensions of \u03bb and A.

W e shall now\ndescribe this law of addition using  the graphical\nmethod. Let us consider two vectors A and B that\nlie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a).  The lengths\nof the line segments representing these vectors\nare proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.\nTo find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that\nits tail is at the head of the vector A, as in\nFig. 4.4(b).

Consider  two  vectors A and\n\u2013A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (\u2013A).\nSince the magnitudes of the two vectors are the\nsame, but the directions are opposite, the\nresultant vector has zero magnitude and is\nrepresented by 0 called a null vector  or a zero\nvector  :\nA \u2013 A = 0         |0|= 0 (4.3)\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its\ndirection cannot be specified.\nThe null vector also results when we multiply\na vector A by the number zero. The main\nproperties of 0 are :\nA + 0 = A\n\u03bb 0 = 0\n0 A = 0        (4.4)\nFig. 4.5  (a)Two vectors A and B, \u2013 B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B from vector A \u2013 the result is R2. For\ncomparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R1 is also shown.What is the physical meaning of a zero vector?\nConsider the position and displacement vectors\nin a plane as shown in Fig. 4.1(a). Now suppose\nthat an object which is at P at time t, moves to\nP\u2032 and then comes back to P. Then, what is its\ndisplacement? Since the initial and final\npositions coincide, the displacement is a \u201cnull\nvector\u201d.\nSubtraction of vectors can be defined in terms\nof addition of vectors. We define the difference\nof two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors\nA and \u2013 B :\nA \u2013 B = A + (\u2013B) (4.5)\nIt is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector  \u2013B is added to\nvector A to get R2 = (A \u2013 B). The vector R1 = A + B\nis also shown in the same figure for comparison.\nWe can also use the parallelogram method to\nfind the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have\ntwo vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we\nbring their tails to a common origin O as\nshown in Fig. 4.6 (a). Then we draw a line from\nthe head of A parallel to B and another line from\nthe head of B parallel to A to complete a\nparallelogram O QSP.  Now we join the point of\nthe intersection of these two lines to the origin\nO. The resultant vector R is directed from the\ncommon origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the\nparallelogram  [Fig. 4.6 (b)]. In Fig.4.6 (c), the\ntriangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A\nand B and we see that the two methods yield the\nsame result. Thus, the two methods are\nequivalent.\n2020-21",

(c) A1 and  A2 expressed in terms of /circumflexnospi and /circumflexnospj.a given vector into two component vectors along\na set of two vectors \u2013 all the three lie in the same\nplane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector\nalong the axes of a rectangular coordinate\nsystem using vectors of unit magnitude. These\nare called unit vectors  that we discuss now. A\nunit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and\npoints in a particular direction. It has no\ndimension and unit. It is used to specify a\ndirection only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and\nz-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are\ndenoted by /circumflexnospi, /circumflexnospj and \u02c6k, respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 4.9(a).\nSince these are unit vectors, we have\n\uf8e6\u02c6i  \uf8e6 = \uf8e6\u02c6j\uf8e6 = \uf8e6\u02c6k\uf8e6=1 (4.9)\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each\nother. In this text, they are printed in bold face\nwith a cap (^) to distinguish them from other\nvectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two\ndimensions in this chapter, we require use of\nonly two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,\nsay \u02c6n by a scalar, the result is a vector\n\u03bb \u03bb\u03bb \u03bb\u03bb = \u03bb\u02c6n.  In general, a vector A can be written as\nA = |A|\u02c6n (4.10)\nwhere \u02c6nis a unit vector along A.\nWe can now resolve a vector A in terms\nof component vectors that lie along unit vectors\ni\u02c6 and /circumflexnospj.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y\nplane as shown in Fig. 4.9(b). We draw lines from\nthe head of A perpendicular to the coordinate\naxes as in Fig. 4.9(b), and get vectors A1 and A2\nsuch that  A1 + A2 = A. Since A1 is parallel to  /circumflexnospiand A2 is parallel to /circumflexnospj,  we have :\nA1= Ax /circumflexnospi,  A2 = Ay /circumflexnospj (4.11)\nwhere Ax  and  Ay are real numbers.\nThus,    A = Ax  /circumflexnospi+ Ay /circumflexnospj              (4.12)\nThis is represented in Fig. 4.9(c). The quantities\nAx  and Ay  are called x-, and y- components of the\nvector A. Note that Ax is itself not a vector, but\nAx /circumflexnospi is a vector, and so is Ay /circumflexnospj. Using simple\ntrigonometry, we can express Ax   and Ay in terms\nof the magnitude of A and the angle \u03b8 it makes\nwith the x-axis :\nAx  = A cos \u03b8\nAy = A sin \u03b8 (4.13)\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.13), a component of a\nvector can be positive, negative or zero\ndepending on the value of \u03b8.\nNow, we have two ways to specify a vector A\nin a plane. It can be specified by :\n(i)its magnitude A and the direction \u03b8 it makes\nwith the x-axis; or\n(ii)its components Ax and Ay\nIf A and \u03b8  are given,  Ax and Ay  can be obtained\nusing Eq.

If Ax  and Ay   are given, A and \u03b8\ncan be obtained as follows :\nA A A Ax2\ny2 2 2 2 2+ = + cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8\n = A2\nOr, A A Ax2\ny2= +      (4.14)\nAnd tan , tan\u03b8 \u03b8= =\u2212 A\nAA\nAy\nxy\nx1             (4.15)\n2020-21",

An object that is in flight after being\nthrown or projected is called a projectile .  Such\na projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a\nbaseball or any other object. The motion of a\nprojectile may be thought of as the result of two\nseparate, simultaneously occurring components\nof motions. One component is along a horizontal\ndirection without  any acceleration and the other\nalong the vertical direction with constant\nacceleration due to the force of gravity. It was\nGalileo who first stated this independency of the\nhorizontal and the vertical components of\nprojectile motion in his Dialogue on the great\nworld systems  (1632).\nIn our discussion, we shall assume that the\nair resistance has negligible effect on the motion\nof the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is\nlaunched with velocity vo that makes an angle\n\u03b8o with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 4.17.\nAfter the object has been projected, the\nacceleration acting on it is that due to gravity\nwhich is directed vertically downward:\na j= \u2212g /circumflexnosp\nOr, ax = 0, ay = \u2013 g (4.36)\nThe components of initial velocity vo are :\nvox = vo cos \u03b8o\nvoy= vo sin \u03b8o       (4.37)If we take the initial position to be the origin of\nthe reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we\nhave :\nxo = 0, yo = 0\nThen, Eq.(4.34b) becomes :\nx = vox t = (vo cos \u03b8o ) t\nand y = (vo sin \u03b8o ) t \u2013 ( \u00bd  )g t2      (4.38)\nThe components of velocity at time t can be\nobtained using Eq.(4.33b) :\nvx = vox = vo cos \u03b8o\nvy = vo sin \u03b8o \u2013 g t (4.39)\nEquation (4.38) gives the x-, and y-coordinates\nof the position of a projectile at time t in terms of\ntwo parameters \u2014 initial speed vo and projection\nangle \u03b8o. Notice that the choice of mutually\nperpendicular x-, and y-directions for the\nanalysis of the projectile motion has resulted in\na simplification. One of the components of\nvelocity, i.e. x-component remains constant\nthroughout the motion and only the\ny- component changes, like an object in free fall\nin vertical direction.

Suppose an object is\nmoving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius\nR as shown in Fig. 4.19. Since the velocity of the\nobject is changing continuously in direction, the\nobject undergoes acceleration. Let us find the\nmagnitude and the direction of this acceleration.Neglecting air resistance - what does\nthe assumption really mean?\nWhile treating the topic of projectile motion,\nwe have stated that we assume that the\nair resistance has no effect on the motion\nof the projectile. You must understand what\nthe statement really means. Friction, force\ndue to viscosity, air resistance are all\ndissipative forces. In the presence of any of\nsuch forces opposing motion, any object will\nlose some part of its initial energy and\nconsequently, momentum too. Thus, a\nprojectile that traverses a parabolic path\nwould certainly show deviation from its\nidealised trajectory in the presence of air\nresistance. It will not hit the ground with\nthe same speed with which it was projected\nfrom it. In the absence of air resistance, the\nx-component of the velocity remains\nconstant and it is only the y-component that\nundergoes a continuous change. However,\nin the presence of air resistance, both of\nthese would get affected. That would mean\nthat the range would be less than the one\ngiven by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height\nattained would also be less than that\npredicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then,\nanticipate the change in the time of flight?\nIn order to avoid air resistance, we will\nhave to perform the experiment in vacuum\nor under low pressure, which is not easy.\nWhen we use a phrase like \u2018neglect air\nresistance\u2019, we imply that the change in\nparameters such as range, height etc. is\nmuch smaller than their values without air\nresistance. The calculation without air\nresistance is much simpler than that with\nair resistance.\n2020-21",

A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n\u201cCentripetal\u201d comes from a Greek term which means\n\u2018centre-seeking\u2019.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However, the direction changes \u2014\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.  As the object moves\nfrom P to P \u2032 in time \u2206t (= t\u2032 \u2013 t), the line CP\n(Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle \u2206\u03b8  as shown\nin the figure. \u2206\u03b8  is called angular distance.  We\ndefine the angular speed \u03c9 (Greek letter omega)\nas the time rate of change of angular\ndisplacement :\n\u03c9\u03b8\n=\u2206\n\u2206t     (4.45)\nNow, if the distance travelled by the object\nduring the time \u2206t is \u2206s, i.e. PP\u2032 is \u2206s, then :\nvs\nt=\u2206\n\u2206\nbut \u2206s = R \u2206\u03b8. Therefore :\nv R\nt= =\u2206\n\u2206\u03b8\n\u03c9R \nv =  R \u03c9 (4.46)\nWe can express centripetal acceleration ac in\nterms of angular speed :av\nRR\nRRc= = =2 2\n2 \u03c9\n\u03c92\na Rc=\u03c92(4.47)\nThe time taken by an object to make one revolution\nis known as its time period T and the number of\nrevolution made in one second is called its\nfrequency  \u03bd (=1/T).  However, during this time the\ndistance moved by the object is s = 2\u03c0R.\nTherefore, v = 2\u03c0R/T =2\u03c0R\u03bd (4.48)\nIn terms of frequency \u03bd, we have\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03bd\n           v = 2\u03c0R\u03bd\nac = 4\u03c02 \u03bd2R                                       (4.49)\nExample 4.10 An insect trapped in a\ncircular groove of radius 12 cm moves along\nthe groove steadily and completes 7\nrevolutions in 100 s.

The angular speed \u03c9 is\ngiven by\n\u03c9 = 2 \u03c0/T = 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 7/100 = 0.44 rad/s\nThe linear speed v is :\nv =\u03c9 R = 0.44 s-1 \u00d7 12 cm =  5.3 cm s-1\nThe direction of velocity v is along the tangent\nto the circle at every point.

Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both.  Examples are\ndisplacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.\n3. A vector A multiplied by a real number \u03bb  is also a vector, whose magnitude is \u03bb times\nthe magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending\nupon whether \u03bb is positive or negative.\n4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram\nmethod .\n5. Vector addition is commutative :\nA + B = B + A\nIt also obeys the associative law :\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)\n6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we\ndon\u2019t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :\nA + 0 = A\n     \u03bb0 = 0\n   0 A = 0\n7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and \u2013B :\nA \u2013 B = A+ (\u2013B)\n8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the\nsame plane :\nA = \u03bb a + \u00b5 b\nwhere \u03bb and \u00b5  are real numbers.\n9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:\n\u02c6nA\nA=\nThe unit vectors  /circumflexnosp/circumflexnosp/circumflexnospi, j, k  are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of\nthe x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.\n10. A vector A can be expressed as\nA i + j=A Ax y/circumflexnosp/circumflexnosp\nwhere Ax, Ay are its components along x-, and y -axes.  If vector A makes an angle \u03b8\nwith the x-axis, then Ax = A cos \u03b8, Ay=A sin \u03b8 and  2 2,  tan = .y\nx y\nxA\nA A AA\u03b8 = = +A\n11. Vectors can be conveniently added using analytical method .  If sum of two vectors A\nand B, that lie in x-y plane, is R, then :\nR i j= +R Rx y/circumflexnosp/circumflexnosp, where,  Rx = Ax + Bx, and     Ry = Ay + By\n12. The position vector of an object in x-y plane is given by r = i j x y/circumflexnosp/circumflexnosp+  and the\ndisplacement from position r to position r\u2019 is given by\n\u2206r = r\u2032\u2212 r\n=\u2032\u2212 + \u2032\u2212 ( ) ( ) x x y y/circumflexnosp/circumflexnospi j\n=  \u2206 + \u2206x y /circumflexnosp/circumflexnospi j\n13.

    "content": "MOTION IN A PLANE 85\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as\nthe magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n2.In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n3.The vector equations (4.33a) and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 \u2212 v2.\nHere v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if\nthe speed is constant.\n7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration\nalone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial\nvelocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration\ndue to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.\nEXERCISES\n4.1 State, for each of the following physical quantities, if it is a scalar or a vector :\nvolume, mass, speed, acceleration, density, number of moles, velocity, angular\nfrequency, displacement, angular velocity.\n4.2 Pick out the two scalar quantities in the following list :\nforce, angular momentum, work, current, linear momentum, electric field, average\nvelocity, magnetic moment, relative velocity.\n4.3 Pick out the only vector quantity in the following list :\nTemperature, pressure, impulse, time, power, total path length, energy, gravitational\npotential, coefficient of friction, charge.\n4.4 State with reasons, whether the following algebraic operations with scalar and vector\nphysical quantities are meaningful :\n(a) adding any two scalars, (b) adding a scalar to a vector of the same dimensions ,\n(c) multiplying any vector by any scalar, (d) multiplying any two scalars, (e) adding any\ntwo vectors, (f) adding a component of a vector to the same vector.\n4.5 Read each statement below carefully and state with  reasons, if it is true or false :\n(a) The magnitude of a vector is always a scalar, (b) each component of a vector is\nalways a scalar, (c) the total path length is always equal to the magnitude of the\ndisplacement vector of a particle.

W e saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far , we have not asked the question as to what\ngover ns the motion of bodies. In this chapter , we tur n to this\nbasic question.\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  Y ou can stop a ball r olling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in\nmotion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is\nneeded to provide this force. The external agency may or may\nnot be in contact with the body.\nSo far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.\na skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal\nice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in\nuniform motion?5.1 Introduction\n5.2 Aristotle\u2019s fallacy\n5.3 The law of inertia\n5.4 Newton\u2019s first law of motion\n5.5 Newton\u2019s second law of\nmotion\n5.6 Newton\u2019s third law of motion\n5.7 Conservation of momentum\n5.8 Equilibrium of a particle\n5.9 Common forces in mechanics\n5.10 Circular motion\n5.11 Solving problems in\nmechanics\nSummary\nPoints to ponder\nExercises\nAdditional exercises\n2020-21",

    "content": "PHYSICS 90\n5.2  ARISTOTLE\u2019S  FALLACY\nThe question posed above appears to be simple.\nHowever, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C\u2013 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion .\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle\u2019s argument? The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force  ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at thetrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.\n5.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane\naccelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.\n(iii) Motion  on a horizontal  plane   is an\nintermediate situation.  Galileo concluded that\nan object moving on a frictionless horizontal\nplane must neither have acceleration nor\nretardation, i.e. it should move with constant\nvelocity (Fig. 5.1(a)).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 5.1(a)\nAnother experiment by Galileo leading to the\nsame conclusion involves a double inclined plane.\nA ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls\ndown and climbs up the other. If the planes are\nsmooth , the final height of the ball is nearly  the\nsame as the initial height (a little less but never\ngreater). In the ideal situation, when friction is\nabsent, the final height of the ball is the same\nas its initial height.\nIf the slope of the second plane is decreased\nand the experiment repeated, the ball will still\nreach the same height, but in doing so , it will\ntravel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when\nthe slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a\nhorizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.\nIn other words, its motion never cease s. This is,\nof course, an idealised situation  (Fig. 5.1(b)) .\nFig. 5.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo\nfrom observations of motion of a ball on a\ndouble inclined plane.\n2020-21",

    "content": "LAWS OF MOTION 91\nIn practice, the ball does come to a stop after\nmoving  a finite distance on the horizontal plane,\nbecause of the opposing force of friction which\ncan never be totally  eliminated.  However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia. Inertia means \u2018resistance to  change\u2019 .\nA body does not change its state of rest or\nuniform motion, unless an external force\ncompels it to change that state.\n5.4  NEWTON\u2019S FIRST LAW OF MOTION\nGalileo\u2019s simple, but revolutionary ideas\ndethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new\nmechanics had to be developed. This task wasIdeas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science\nAncient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter\u2019s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be\nindicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept\nof \u2018instantaneous motion\u2019 ( tatkaliki gati ), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous\nvelocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly\nunderstood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results\nfrom the transmission of vibrations of water particles.accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac\nNewton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.\nNewton built on Galileo\u2019s ideas and laid the\nfoundation of mechanics in terms of three laws\nof  motion that go by his name.  Galileo\u2019s law of\ninertia was his starting point which he\nformulated as the first law of motion :\nEvery body continues to be in its state\nof rest or of uniform motion in a straight\nline unless compelled by some external\nforce to act otherwise.\nThe state of rest or uniform linear motion both\nimply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can,\ntherefore, be simply expressed as:\nIf the net external force on a body is zero, its\nacceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non\nzero only if there is a net external force on\nthe body.\nTwo kinds of situations are encountered in the\napplication of this law in practice. In some\nexamples, we know that the net external force\non the object is zero. In that case we can\nconclude that the acceleration of the object is\nzero.  For example, a spaceship out in\ninterstellar space, far from all other  objects and\nwith all its rockets turned off, has no net\nexternal force acting on it.  Its acceleration,\naccording to the first law, must be zero.  If it is\nin motion, it must continue to move with a\nuniform velocity.\n2020-21",

In that case, if we know\nthat an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either\nat rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer\nfrom the first law that the net external force on\nthe object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.\nFor terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every\nobject experiences gravitational force due to the\nearth.  Also objects in motion generally experience\nfriction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an\nobject is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is\nnot because there are no forces acting on it, but\nbecause the various external forces cancel out\ni.e. add up to zero net external force.\nConsider a book at rest on a horizontal surface\nFig. (5.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces  :\nthe force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting\ndownward and the upward force on the book by\nthe table, the normal force R. R is a self-adjusting\nforce. This is an example of the kind of situation\nmentioned above. The forces are not quite known\nfully but the state of motion is known. We observe\nthe book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude\nfrom the first law that the magnitude of R equals\nthat of W. A statement often encountered is  :\n\u201cSince W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book\nis at rest\u201d. This is incorrect reasoning . The correct\nstatement is  : \u201cSince the book is observed to be at\nrest, the net external force on it must be zero,\naccording to the f irst law. This implies that theGalileo Galilei, born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientific revolution\nin Europe about four centuries ago.  Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration.\nFrom experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely, he\ncontradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in\nmotion, and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity.  He\nthus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent\nepochal work of Isaac Newton.\nGalileo\u2019s discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary.  In 1609, he designed\nhis own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of\nstartling  observations :  mountains  and depressions on  the  surface of the moon;\ndark spots on the sun; the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus.  He concluded\nthat the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye.\nIn his masterpiece of scientific reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated\nthe heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus, which eventually got universal\nacceptance.\nWith Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientific inquiry. Science was no longer\nmerely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments\nto verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical\nrelations between them. Not undeservedly, many regard Galileo as the father of modern science.\nnormal force R  must be equal and opposite to the\nweight  W \u201d.\nFig. 5.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b)  a car\nmoving with uniform velocity. The net force\nis zero in each case.\nConsider the motion of a car starting from\nrest, picking up speed and then moving on a\nsmooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.\n(5.2(b)).  When the car is stationary, there is no\nnet force acting on it. During pick-up, it\naccelerates. This must happen due to a net\nexternal force. Note, it has to be an external force.\nThe acceleration of the car cannot be accounted\nfor by any internal force.  This might sound\nsurprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable\nexternal force along the road is the force of\nfriction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates\nthe car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction\nin section 5.9).  When the car moves with\nconstant velocity, there is no net external force.\nGalileo Galilei (1564 - 1642)\n2020-21",

The\nfollowing common experiences indicate the\nimportance of this quantity for considering the\neffect of force on motion.\n\u2022Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small\ncar) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded\ntruck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all\nknow that a much greater force is needed to\npush the truck than the car to bring them to\nthe same speed in same time.  Similarly, a\ngreater opposing force is needed to stop a\nheavy body than a light body in the same time,\nif they are moving with the same speed.\n\u2022If two stones, one light and the other heavy,\nare dropped from the top of a building, a\nperson on the ground will find it easier to catch\nthe light stone than the heavy stone.  The\nmass of a body is thus an important\nparameter that determines the effect of force\non its motion.\n\u2022Speed is another important parameter to\nconsider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily\npierce human tissue before it stops, resulting\nin casualty.  The same bullet fired with\nmoderate speed will not cause much damage.\nThus for a given mass, the greater the speed,\nthe greater is the opposing force needed to stop\nthe body in a certain time.  Taken together,\nthe product of mass and velocity, that is\nmomentum, is evidently a relevant variable\nof motion. The greater the change in the\nmomentum in a given time, the  greater is the\nforce that needs to be applied.\n\u2022A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball\ncoming in with great speed far more easily\nthan a novice, who can hurt his hands in the\nact.  One reason is that the cricketer allows a\nlonger time for his hands to stop the ball.  As\nyou may have noticed, he draws in the hands\nbackward in the act of catching the ball (Fig.\n5.3).  The novice, on the other hand, keeps\nhis hands fixed and tries to catch the ball\nalmost instantly. He needs to provide a much\ngreater force to stop the ball instantly, andThe property of inertia contained in the First\nlaw is evident in many situations.  Suppose we\nare standing in a stationary  bus and the driver\nstarts the bus suddenly. We get thrown\nbackward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch\nwith the floor. If there were no friction, we would\nremain where we were, while the floor of the bus\nwould simply slip forward under our feet and the\nback of the bus would hit us.  However,\nfortunately, there is some friction between the\nfeet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden,\ni.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional\nforce would be enough to accelerate our feet\nalong with the bus.  But our body is not strictly\na rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some\nrelative displacement between different parts.\nWhat this means is that while our feet go with\nthe bus, the rest of the body remains where it is\ndue to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we\nare thrown backward.  As soon as that happens,\nhowever, the muscular forces on the rest of the\nbody (by the feet) come into play to move the body\nalong with the bus. A similar thing happens\nwhen the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due\nto the friction which does not allow relative\nmotion between the feet and the floor of the bus.\nBut the rest of the body continues to move\nforward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward.\nThe restoring muscular forces again come into\nplay and bring the body to rest.\nExample 5.1  An astronaut accidentally\ngets separated out of his small spaceship\naccelerating in inter stellar space at a\nconstant rate of 100 m s\u20132.  What is the\nacceleration of the astronaut the instant after\nhe is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that\nthere are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him.)\nAnswer   Since there are no nearby stars to exert\ngravitational force on him and the small\nspaceship exerts negligible gravitational\nattraction on him, the net force acting on the\nastronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is\nzero. By the first law of motion the acceleration\nof the astronaut is zero.              /triangleleft\n5.5  NEWTON\u2019S SECOND LAW OF MOTION\nThe first law refers to the simple case when the\nnet external force on a body is zero.

The same change in momentum\nbrought about in a shorter time needs a\ngreater applied force. In short, the greater the\nrate of change of momentum, the greater is\nthe force.\nFig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in\nmomentum but also on how fast the change\nis brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws\nin his hands during a catch, allowing greater\ntime for the ball to stop  and hence requires a\nsmaller force .\n\u2022Observations confirm that the product of\nmass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to\nthe effect of force on motion.  Suppose a fixed\nforce is applied for a certain interval of time\non two bodies of different masses, initially at\nrest,  the lighter body picks up a greater speed\nthan the heavier body.  However, at the end of\nthe time interval, observations show that each\nbody acquires the same momentum.  Thus\nthe same force for the same time causes\nthe same change in momentum for\ndifferent bodies .  This is a crucial clue to the\nsecond law of motion.\n\u2022In the preceding observations, the vector\ncharacter of momentum has not been evident.\nIn the examples so far, momentum and change\nin momentum both have the same direction.\nBut this is not always the case.  Suppose a\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\ndirection changes (Fig. 5.4). A force is needed\nto cause this change in momentum vector .This force is provided by our hand through\nthe string.  Experience suggests that our hand\nneeds to exert a greater force if the stone is\nrotated at greater speed or in a circle of\nsmaller radius, or both. This corresponds to\ngreater acceleration or equivalently a greater\nrate of change in momentum vector. This\nsuggests that the greater the rate of change\nin momentum vector the greater is the force\napplied.\nFig. 5.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction\nof momentum, even if its magnitude is\nconstant. We can feel this while rotating a\nstone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed\nby means of a string .\nThese qualitative observations lead to the\nsecond law of motion  expressed by Newton as\nfollows :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is\ndirectly proportional to the applied force and\ntakes place in the direction in which the force\nacts.\nThus, if under the action of a force F for time\ninterval \u2206t, the velocity of a body of mass m\nchanges from v to v + \u2206v i.e. its initial momentum\np = mv changes by m \u2206 = \u2206p v . According to the\nSecond Law,\n            or     kt t\u2206 \u2206\u221d =\u2206 \u2206p pF F\nwhere k  is a constant of proportionality.  Taking\nthe limit \u2206t \u2192 0,  the term t\u2206\u2206p becomes the\nderivative or differential co-efficient of p with\nrespect to t , denoted by d\ndtp.  Thus\n2020-21",

The\ncomponent of velocity normal to the force\nremains unchanged. For example, in the\nmotion of a projectile under the vertical\ngravitational force, the horizontal component\nof velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).\n3.The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is\napplicable to a single point particle. The force\nF in the law stands for the net external forc eon the particle and a stands for acceleration\nof the particle. It turns out, however, that the\nlaw in the same form applies to a rigid body or,\neven more generally, to a system of particles.\nIn that case, F refers to the total external force\non the system and a refers to the acceleration\nof the system as a whole.  More precisely, a is\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\nsystem about which we shall study in detail in\nchapter 7 . Any internal forces in the system\nare not to be included in  F.\nFig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is determined by\nthe force at that instant. The moment after a\nstone is dropped out of an accelerated train,\nit has no horizontal acceleration or force, if\nair resistance is neglected.

For\nexample, when a ball hits a wall and bounces\nback, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a\nvery short time when the two are in contact , yet\nthe force is large enough to reverse the momentum\nof the ball. Often, in these situations, the force\nand the time duration are difficult to ascertain\nseparately. However, the product of force and time,\nwhich is the change in momentum of the body\nremains a measurable quantity. This product is\ncalled  impulse:\nImpulse  =  Force \u00d7 time duration\n          =  Change in momentum        (5.7)\nA large force acting for a short time to produce a\nfinite change in momentum is called an impulsive\nforce. In the history of science, impulsive forces\nwere put in a conceptually different category fromordinary forces.  Newtonian mechanics has no\nsuch distinction.  Impulsive force is like any other\nforce \u2013 except that it is large and acts for a short\ntime.\nExample 5. 4  A batsman hits back a ball\nstraight in the direction of the bowler without\nchanging its initial speed of 12  m s\u20131.\nIf the mass of the ball is 0.15 kg, determine\nthe impulse imparted to the ball.

What is the origin of the\nexternal force on the body ?  What agency\nprovides the external force ?  The simple answer\nin Newtonian mechanics is that the external\nforce on a body always arises due to some other\nbody.  Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives\nrise to an external force on A.  A natural question\nis: Does A in turn give rise to an external force\non B ?  In some examples, the answer seems\nclear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is\ncompressed by the force of your hand.  The\ncompressed spring in turn exerts a force on your\nhand and you can feel it.  But what if the bodies\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\nits motion is negligible.\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\n2020-21",

This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion .\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\nNewton\u2019s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction .\n1.The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmean nothing else but \u2018force\u2019. Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollow s:\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n2.The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that actioncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n3.Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\nFAB  =  \u2013 FBA  (5.8)\n(force on A by B)  =  \u2013 (force on B by A)\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\none body ( A or B), only one of the two forces is\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\nand claim that the net force is zero.\nHowever, if you are considering the system\nof two bodies as a whole, FAB and FBA are\ninternal forces of the system ( A + B ). They add\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\nin pairs.  This is an important fact that\nenables the second law to be applicable to a\nbody or a system of particles (See Chapter 7).\nIsaac Newton (1642 \u2013 1727)\nIsaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England in 1642, the year Galileo died.\nHis extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden\nfrom others in his school life.   In 1662, he went to Cambridge for undergraduate\nstudies.  A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton\nhad to return to his mother\u2019s farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant\ncreativity blossomed  in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and\nphysics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents, the beginning of\ncalculus, the inverse square law of gravitation, the spectrum of white light, and so\non. Returning to Cambridge, he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a\nreflecting telescope.\nIn 1684, encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley, Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of\nthe greatest scientific works ever published : The Principia Mathematica.  In it, he enunciated the three\nlaws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, which explained all the three Kepler\u2019s laws of\nplanetary motion.  The book was packed with a host of path-breaking achievements : basic principles of\nfluid mechanics, mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth, the sun and other\nplanets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes, theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out\nanother masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour.\nThe scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo\nwas brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics unified terrestrial and celestial\nphenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the\nmotion of the moon around the earth.  The age of reason had dawned.\n2020-21",

(ii) the ratio of the\nmagnitudes of impulses imparted to the\nballs by the wall ?\n       Fig. 5.6\nAnswer   An instinctive answer to (i) might be\nthat the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to\nthe wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30\u00b0\nto the normal. This answer is wrong.  The force\non the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.\nHow to find the force on the wall? The trick is\nto consider the force (or impulse) on  the ball\ndue to  the wall using the second law, and then\nuse the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed\nof each ball before and after collision with the\nwall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x\nand y axes as shown in the figure, and consider\nthe change in momentum of the ball in each\ncase :\nCase (a)\n() () initial initial 0x y p mu          p = =\n() ()final final0x y p mu          p = \u2212 =\nImpulse is the change in momentum vector.\nTherefore,\nx-component of impulse  =  \u2013 2 m u\ny-component of impulse  =   0\nImpulse and force are in the same direction.\nClearly, from above, the force on the ball due to\nthe wall is normal to the wall, along the negative\nx-direction.  Using Newton\u2019s third law of motion,\nthe force on the wall due to the ball is normal to\nthe wall along the positive x-direction. Themagnitude of force cannot be ascertained since\nthe small time taken for the collision has not\nbeen specified in the problem.\nCase (b)\n()  cos 30 initialxp m u =\u2218, ()    sin 30initialyp m u = \u2212\u2218\n()  \u2013 cos 30 finalxp m u =\u2218, ()   sin 30finalyp m u = \u2212\u2218\nNote,  while px changes sign  after collision,  py\ndoes not.  Therefore,\nx-component of impulse = \u20132 m u  cos  30\u00b0\ny-component of impulse = 0\nThe direction of impulse (and force) is the same\nas in (a) and is normal to the wall along the\nnegative x direction.  As before, using Newton\u2019s\nthird law, the force on the wall due to the ball is\nnormal to the wall along the positive x direction.\nThe ratio of the magnitudes  of the impulses\nimparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is\n( )22 / 2 cos30 1.2\n3m u m u = \u2248\u2218         /triangleleft\n5.7  CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM\nThe second and third laws of motion lead to\nan important consequence: the law of\nconservation of momentum.  Take a familiar\nexample. A bullet is fired  from a gun. If the force\non the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun\nby the bullet is \u2013F, according to the third law.\nThe two forces act for a common interval of time\n\u2206t.  According to the second l aw, F  \u2206t is the\nchange in momentum of the bullet and \u2013F \u2206t is\nthe change in momentum of the gun. Since\ninitially, both are at rest, the change in\nmomentum equals the final momentum  for each .\nThus if pb is the momentum of the bullet after\nfiring and pg is the recoil momentum of the gun,\npg = \u2013pb  i.e. pb + pg = 0.  That is, the total\nmomentum of the (bullet + gun ) system is\nconserved.\nThus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with\nno external force), mutual forces between pairs\nof particles in the system can cause momentum\nchange in individual particles, but since the\nmutual forces for each pair are equal and\nopposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs\nand the total momentum remains unchanged.\nThis fact is known as the law of conservation\nof momentum  :\n2020-21",

As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three\nforces in equilibrium can be represented by the\nsides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken\nin the same sense.

The gravitational force is, of course,\npervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences\nthe force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also\ngoverns the motion of celestial bodies.  The\ngravitational force can act at a distance without\nthe need of any intervening medium.\nAll the other forces common in mechanics are\ncontact forces .* As the name suggests, a contact\nforce on an object arises due to contact with some\nother object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges andother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.  The component of contact force\nnormal to the surfaces in contact is called\nnormal reaction.  The component parallel to the\nsurfaces in contact is called friction.  Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 5.9).\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements). The spring\nforce F is written as F = \u2013 k x where x is the\ndisplacement and k is the force constant. The\nnegative sign denotes that the force is opposite\nto the displacement from the unstretched state.\nFor an inextensible string, the force constant is\nvery high. The restoring force in a string is called\ntension. It is customary to use a constant tension\nT throughout the string. This assumption is true\nfor a string of negligible mass.\nIn Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four\nfundamental forces in nature.  Of these, the weak\nand strong forces appear in domains that do not\nconcern us here. Only the gravitational and\nelectrical forces are relevant in the context of\nmechanics. The different contact forces of\nmechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise\nfrom electrical forces.  This may seem surprising\n*We are not considering,  for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are\nelectrical and magnetic non-contact forces.Fig. 5.9  Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.\n2020-21",

A t the microscopic\nlevel, all bodies are made of charged constituents\n(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact\nforces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular\ncollisions and impacts, etc . can ultimately be\ntraced to the electrical forces between the charged\nconstituents of different bodies. The detailed\nmicroscopic origin of these forces is, however,\ncomplex and not useful  for handling problems in\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale.  This is why\nthey are treated as different types of forces with\ntheir characteristic properties determined\nempirically.\n5.9.1   Friction\nLet us return to the example of a body of mass m\nat rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity\n(mg)  is cancelled by the normal reaction force\n(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied\nhorizontally to the body.  We know from\nexperience that a small  applied force may not\nbe enough to move the body.  But if the applied\nforce F were the only external force on the body,\nit must move with acceleration F/m, however\nsmall. Clearly, the body remains at rest because\nsome other force comes into play in the\nhorizontal direction and opposes the applied\nforce F, resulting in zero net force on the body.\nThis force fs parallel to the surface of the body in\ncontact with the table is known as frictional\nforce, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)).  The\nsubscript stands for static friction to distinguish\nit from kinetic friction fk that we consider later\n(Fig. 5.10(b)).  Note that  static friction does not\nFig. 5.10 Static and sliding friction: (a)  Impending\nmotion of the body is opposed by static\nfriction. When external force exceeds the\nmaximum limit of static friction, the body\nbegins to move.  (b) Once the body is in\nmotion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction\nwhich opposes relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is\nusually less than the maximum value of staticexist by itself.  When there is no applied force,\nthere is no static friction. It comes into play the\nmoment there is an applied force. As the applied\nforce F  increases, fs also increases, remaining\nequal and opposite to the applied force (up to a\ncertain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it\nis called static friction.  Static friction opposes\nimpending motion . The term impending motion\nmeans motion that would take place (but does\nnot actually take place) under the applied force,\nif friction were absent.\nWe know from experience that as the applied\nforce exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to\nmove.  It is found experimentally that the limiting\nvalue of static friction ()maxsf  is independent of\nthe area of contact and varies with the normal\nforce (N)  approximately as :\n()maxs sf N =\u00b5 (5.13)\nwhere \u00b5s is a constant of proportionality\ndepending only on the nature of the surfaces in\ncontact. The constant \u00b5s  is called the coefficient\nof static friction.  The law of static friction may\nthus be written as\nfs  \u2264  \u00b5s  N (5.14)\nIf the applied force F exceeds ()maxsf the body\nbegins to slide on the surface. It is found\nexperimentally that when relative motion has\nstarted, the frictional force decreases from the\nstatic maximum value ()maxsf . Frictional force\nthat opposes relative motion between surfaces\nin contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and\nis denoted by fk .  Kinetic friction, like static\nfriction, is found to be independent of the area\nof contact.  Further, it is nearly independent of\nthe velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for\nstatic frictio n:\nk k=f N \u00b5 (5.15)\nwhere \u00b5k\u2032 the coefficient of kinetic friction,\ndepends only on the surfaces in contact. As\nmentioned above, experiments show that \u00b5k is\nless than \u00b5s. When relative motion has begun,\nthe acceleration of the body according to the\nsecond law is ( F \u2013 fk)/m.  For a body moving with\nconstant velocity, F = fk. If the applied force on\nthe body is removed, its acceleration is \u2013 fk /m\nand it eventually comes to a stop.\n       The laws of friction given above do not have\nthe status of fundamental laws like those for\ngravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They\nare empirical relations that are onlyfriction.\n2020-21",

Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train). This impending relative motion is\nopposed by the static friction fs.

Resolving the weight mg\nalong the two directions shown, we have\nm g sin \u03b8  =  fs   ,     m g  cos \u03b8    =  N\nAs \u03b8  increases, the self-adjusting frictional force\nfs increases until at \u03b8 = \u03b8max,  fs achieves its\nmaximum value, ()maxsf = \u00b5s N.\nTherefore,\ntan \u03b8max  =  \u00b5s  or  \u03b8max  =  tan\u20131  \u00b5s\nWhen  \u03b8  becomes just a little more than  \u03b8max ,\nthere is a small net force on the block and it\nbegins to slide.

During rolling, the surfaces\nin contact get momentarily deformed a little, and\nthis results in a finite area (not a point) of the\nbody being in contact with the surface.  The net\neffect is that the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surface opposes motion.\nWe often regard friction as something\nundesirable. In many situations, like in a\nmachine with different moving parts, friction\ndoes have a negative role. It opposes relative\nmotion and thereby dissipates power in the form\nof heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing\nkinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to\nuse ball bearings between two moving parts of a\nmachine [Fig. 5.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction\nbetween ball bearings and the surfaces in\ncontact is very small, power dissipation is\nreduced. A thin cushion of air maintained\nbetween solid surfaces in relative motion is\nanother effective way of reducing friction (Fig.\n5.13(a)).\nIn many practical situations, however, friction\nis critically needed. Kinetic friction that\ndissipates power is nevertheless important for\nquickly stopping relative motion. It is made use\nof by brakes in machines  and automobiles .\nSimilarly, static friction is important in daily\nlife.  We are able to walk because of friction.  It\nis impossible for a car to move on a very slippery\nroad. On an ordinary road, the friction between\nthe tyres and the road provides the necessary\nexternal force to accelerate the car.Answer   As the string is inextensible, and the\npully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg\ntrolley both have same magnitude of\nacceleration.

At every instant, there is\njust one point of contact between the body and\nthe plane and this point has no motion relative\nto the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or\nstatic friction is zero and the body should\ncontinue to roll with constant velocity.  We know,\nin practice, this will not happen and some\nresistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur,\ni.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force\nis needed. For the same weight, rolling friction\nis much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of\nmagnitude) than static or sliding friction.  This\nFig. 5.13  Some ways of reducing friction.

This force\ndirected forwards the centre is called the\ncentripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle\nby a string, the centripetal force is provided by\nthe tension in the string.  The centripetal force\nfor motion of a planet around the sun is theis the static friction that provides the centripetal\nacceleration.

If the speed is too large, or if\nthe turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius)\nor both, the frictional force is not sufficient to\nprovide the necessary centripetal force, and the\ncyclist slips.

At the optimum speed, the normal\nreaction\u2019s component is enough to provide the\nneeded centripetal force, and the frictional force\nis not needed.  The optimum speed vo is given by\nEq.

To handle a typical\nproblem in mechanics systematically, one\nshould use the following steps :\n(i)Draw a diagram showing schematically the\nvarious parts of the assembly of bodies, the\nlinks, supports, etc.\n(ii)Choose a convenient part of the assembly\nas one system.\n(iii)Draw a separate diagram which shows this\nsystem and all the forces on the system by\nthe remaining part of the assembly.  Include\nalso the forces on the system by other\nagencies. Do not include the forces on the\nenvironment by the system .  A diagram of\nthis type is known as \u2018a free-body diagram\u2019.\n(Note this does not imply that the system\nunder consideration is without a net force).\n(iv)In a free-body diagram, include information\nabout forces (their magnitudes and\ndirections) that are either given or you are\nsure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a\nstring along its length).

That is, if in the\nfree-body diagram of A, the force on A due to\nB is shown as F, then in the free-body\ndiagram of B, the force on B due to A  should\nbe shown as \u2013 F.\nThe following example illustrates the above\nprocedure :\nExample 5.12 See Fig. 5.15. A wooden\nblock of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal\nfloor.  When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg\nis placed on top of the block, the floor yields\nsteadily and the block and the cylinder\ntogether go down with an acceleration of\n0.1 m s\u20132.  What is the action of the block\non the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor\nyields ? Take g = 10 m s\u20132. Identify the\naction-reaction pairs in the problem.\nAnswer\n(a)The block is at rest on the floor. Its free-body\ndiagram shows two forces on the block, the\nforce of gravitational attraction by the earth\nequal to 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 N; and the normal force\nR of the floor on the block. By the First Law,the net force on the block must be zero i.e.,\nR = 20 N.  Using third law the action of the\nblock (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by\nthe block) is equal to 20 N and directed\nvertically downwards.\n(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates\ndownwards with 0.1  m s-2. The free-body\ndiagram of the system shows two forces on\nthe system  : the force of gravity due to the\nearth (270 N); and the normal force R\u2032 by the\nfloor.

A number\nof exercises in this and subsequent chapters will\nhelp you cultivate this practice.\nSUMMARY\n1.Aristotle\u2019s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n2.Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton\u2019s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\nthus: \u201cEverybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise\u201d .  In simple terms, the First Law\nis \u201cIf external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero\u201d .\n3.Momentum ( p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\np  =  m v\n4.Newton\u2019s second law of motion :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus\nd\ndk k m \nt= =pF a\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\nd\ndm\nt= =pF a\nThe SI unit of force is newton  : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n(a)The second law is consistent with the First Law ( F = 0 implies a = 0)\n(b)It is a vector equation\n(c)It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\na whole.\n(d)F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\nhistory of motion.\n5.Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\nthe action of the impulsive force.\n6.Newton\u2019s third law of motion:\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\n2020-21",

    "content": "PHYSICS 108\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\n7.Law of Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\n8.Friction\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction fs opposes impending relative\nmotion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\n()maxf f R s s s\u2264 = \u00b5\nkf Rk=\u00b5\n\u00b5s (co-efficient of static friction) and \u00b5k (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\nexperimentally that \u00b5k is less than \u00b5s .\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\nmay be along v , opposite to v, normal to v  or may make some other angle with\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\n2.If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v  = 0 but the force continues\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\n3.Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\nthe body at that time.  Force is not \u2018carried\u2019 by the body from its earlier history of\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\n4.In the second law of motion F = m  a, F stands for the net force due to all\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\n2020-21",

It is\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\nbody in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\nin any circular motion.\n6.Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit \u00b5s N (fs \u2264 \u00b5s N).  Do not put\nfs=\u00b5s N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\ninto play.\n7.The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n8.The terms \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018reaction\u2019 in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n9.The different terms like \u2018friction\u2019, \u2018normal reaction\u2019 \u2018tension\u2019, \u2018air resistance\u2019,\n\u2018viscous drag\u2019, \u2018thrust\u2019, \u2018buoyancy\u2019, \u2018weight\u2019, \u2018centripetal force\u2019 all stand for \u2018force\u2019\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase \u2018force on A by B\u2019.\n10.For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\n11.The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\nsubjective concept of the \u2018feeling of force\u2019.

A farmer ploughing the field, a\nconstruction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for\na competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful\nlandscape , all ar e said to be working. In physics, however ,\nthe word \u2018W ork\u2019 cover s a definite  and precise meaning.\nSomebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a\nday is said to have a large stamina or ener gy. W e admir e a\nlong distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is\nthus our capacity to do work . In Physics too, the term \u2018energy\u2019\nis related to work in this sense, but as said above the term\n\u2018work\u2019 itself is defined much more precisely. The wor d \u2018power\u2019\nis used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In\nkarate or boxing we talk of \u2018powerful\u2019 punches. These are\ndelivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to\nthe meaning of the wor d \u2018power\u2019 used in physics.  We shall\nfind that there is at best a loose correlation betwee n the\nphysical definitions and the physiological pictures these\nterms generate in our minds.  The aim of this chapter is to\ndevelop an understanding of these three physi cal quantities.\nBefore we proceed to this task, we need to develop a\nmathematical prerequisit e, namely the scalar product of two\nvectors.\n6.1.1 The Scalar Product\nWe have lear nt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4.\nPhysical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,\nforce etc. ar e vectors.

There are two ways of multiplying vectors which\nwe shall come across : one way known as the scalar product\ngives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the\nvector pr oduct pr oduces a new vector fr om two vectors. W e\nshall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take\nup the scalar product of two vectors.

Since A, B and cos \u03b8 are\nscalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar\nquantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction\nbut their scalar product does not have a\ndirection.\nFrom Eq.

Consider a\nconstant force F acting on an object of mass m.\nThe object undergoes a displacement d in the\npositive x-direction as shown in Fig. 6.2.\nFig. 6.2 An object undergoes a displacement d\nunder the influence of the force F .6.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC\nENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM\nThe following relation for rectilinear motion under\nconstant acceleration a has been encountered\nin Chapter 3,\n      v2 \u2212 u2 = 2 as (6.2)\nwhere u and v   are the initial and final speeds\nand s the distance traversed.  Multiplying both\nsides by m/2, we have\n2 2 1 1\n2 2mv mu mas Fs \u2212 = = (6.2a)\nwhere the last step follows from Newton\u2019s Second\nLaw. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three\ndimensions by employing vectors\nv2 \u2212 u2 = 2 a.d\nHere a  and d are acceleration and displacement\nvectors of the object respectively.\nOnce again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain\n2 2 1 1\n2 2mv mu m \u2212 = = a.d F.d (6.2b)\nThe above equation provides a motivation for\nthe definitions of work and kinetic energy. The\nleft side of the equation is the difference in the\nquantity \u2018half the mass times the square of the\nspeed\u2019 from its initial value to its final value. We\ncall each of these quantities the \u2018kinetic energy\u2019,\ndenoted by K. The right side is a product of the\ndisplacement and the component of the force\nalong the displacement.  This quantity is called\n\u2018work\u2019 and is denoted by W.  Eq. (6.2b) is then\nKf \u2212  Ki = W (6.3)\nwhere Ki  and Kf  are respectively the initial and\nfinal kinetic energies of the object. Work refers\nto the force and the displacement over which it\nacts. Work is done by a force on the body over\na certain displacement .\nEquation (6.2) is also a special case of the\nwork-energy (WE) theorem : The change in\nkinetic energy of a particle is equal to the\nwork done on it by the net force . We shall\ngeneralise the above derivation to a varying force\nin a later section.\nExample 6.2   It is well known that a\nraindrop falls under the influence of the\ndownward gravitational force and the\nopposing resistive force.  The latter is known\n2020-21",

During this process, the force\non the cycle due to the road is 200 N and\nis directly opposed to the motion.  (a) How\nmuch work does the road do on the cycle ?\n(b) How much work does the cycle do on\nthe road ?\nAnswer  Work done on the cycle by the road is\nthe work done by the stopping (frictional) force\non the cycle due to the road.\n(a) The stopping force and the displacement make\nan angle of 180o  (\u03c0 rad) with each other.\nThus, work done by the road,\nWr =  Fd cos\u03b8\n     =  200 \u00d7  10 \u00d7 cos \u03c0\n      = \u2013 2000 J\nIt is this negative work that brings the cycle\nto a halt in accordance with WE theorem.\n(b) From Newton\u2019s Third Law an equal and\nopposite force acts on the road due to the\ncycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the\nroad undergoes no displacement.  Thus,\nwork done by cycle on the road is zero.            /triangleleft\nThe lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the\nforce on a body A exerted by the body B is always\nequal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton\u2019s\nThird Law); the work done on A by B is not\nnecessarily equal and opposite to the work done\non B by A.\n6.4  KINETIC ENERGY\nAs noted earlier, if an object of mass m has\nvelocity v, its kinetic energy K  is\n2K m mv1 1= =2 2v v.                        (6.5)\nKinetic  energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic\nenergy of an object is a measure of the work anThe work done by the force is defined to be\nthe product of component of the force in the\ndirection of the displacement and the\nmagnitude of this displacement .  Thus\nW = (F cos \u03b8 )d = F.d (6.4)\nWe see that if there is no displacement, there\nis no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\nthe force you exert on the wall does no work.  Yet\nyour muscles are alternatively contracting and\nrelaxing and internal energy is being used up\nand you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work\nin physics is different from its usage in everyday\nlanguage.\nNo work is done if :\n(i)the displacement is zero as seen in the\nexample above. A weightlifter holding a 150\nkg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s\ndoes no work on the load during this time.\n(ii)the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth\nhorizontal table is not acted upon by a\nhorizontal force (since there is no friction), but\nmay undergo a large displacement .\n(iii)the force and displacement are mutually\nperpendicular. This is so since, for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 rad\n(= 90o), cos (\u03c0/2) = 0.  For the block moving on\na smooth horizontal table, the gravitational\nforce mg  does no work since it acts at right\nangles to the displacement. If we assume that\nthe moon\u2019s orbits around the earth is\nperfectly circular then the earth\u2019s\ngravitational force does no work.  The moon\u2019s\ninstantaneous displacement is tangential\nwhile the earth\u2019s force is radially inwards and\n\u03b8  = \u03c0/2.\nWork can be both positive and negative.  If \u03b8  is\nbetween 0o and 90o, cos \u03b8  in Eq. (6.4) is positive.\nIf  \u03b8  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos \u03b8  is negative.\nIn many examples the frictional force opposes\ndisplacement and \u03b8  = 180o. Then the work done\nby friction is negative (cos 180o = \u20131).\nFrom Eq. (6.4) it is clear that  work and energy\nhave the same dimensions,  [ML2T\u20132]. The SI unit\nof these is joule (J), named after the famous British\nphysicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since\nwork and energy are so widely used as physical\nconcepts, alternative units abound and some of\nthese are listed in Table 6.1.\n2020-21",

The term potential energy\nbrings to one\u2019s mind \u2018stored\u2019 energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth\u2019s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth\u2019s crustare like \u2018compressed springs\u2019. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the \u2018stored energy\u2019 by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By \u2018near\u2019 we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth\u2019s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth\u2019s radius RE (h <<RE) so that\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth\u2019s\nsurface *. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that hei ght.\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational force F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V (h) with respect to h . Thus,\nd\ndF V(h) m gh= \u2212 = \u2212\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n21\nm v2 = m g h\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets \u2018stored up\u2019 as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy.

To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n\u2206V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n\u2206V = \u2212 F(x) \u2206x (6.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\nconverted to kinetic energy. This hints at an\nimportant principle of conservation in mechanics,\nwhich we now proceed to examine.\n6.8THE CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL\nENERGY\nFor simplicity we demonstrate this important\nprinciple for one-dimensional motion. Suppose\nthat a body undergoes displacement \u2206x under\nthe action of a conservative force F. Then from\nthe WE theorem we have,\n\u2206K =  F (x) \u2206x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n\u2212 \u2206V  =  F( x) \u2206x\nThe above equations imply that\n\u2206K + \u2206V = 0\n\u2206(K + V ) = 0 (6.10)which means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\nOver the whole path,  xi to xf, this means that\nKi + V(xi) = Kf  + V(xf) (6.11)\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n\u2018conservative force\u2019 is now clear.\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\nconservative force.\n/circle6A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\n/circle6The work done by the conservative force\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\nW = Kf \u2013 Ki = V (xi) \u2013 V(xf)\nwhich depends on the end points.\n/circle6A third definition states that the work done\nby this force in a closed path is zero.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (6.11) since\nxi  = xf .\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as\nThe total mechanical energy of a system is\nconserved if the forces, doing work on it, are\nconservative .\nThe above discussion can be made more\nconcrete by considering the example of the\ngravitational force once again and that of the\nspring force in the next section.

The spring is light\nand may be treated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring force Fs  is proportional to\nxwhere x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 6.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 6.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke\u2019s law and is mathematically stated as\nFs =  \u2212 kx\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k is\nlarge and soft if k is small.\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 6. 7(b).

We have seen that it can be\nclassified into two distinct categories : one based\non motion, namely kinetic energy; the other on\nconfiguration (position), namely potential energy.\nEnergy comes in many a forms which transform\ninto one another in ways which may not often\nbe clear to us.\n6.10.1  Heat\nWe have seen that the frictional force is not a\nconservative force. However, work is associated\nwith the force of friction, Example 6.5. A block of\nmass m sliding on a rough horizontal surface\nwith speed v0 comes to a halt over a distance x0.\nThe work done by the force of kinetic friction f\nover x0 is \u2013f x0. By the work-energy theorem\n2\no 0 m v /2  f  x . =  If we confine our scope to\nmechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy\nof the block is \u2018lost\u2019 due to the frictional force.\nOn examination of the block and the table we\nwould detect a slight increase in their\ntemperatures. The work done by friction is not\n\u2018lost\u2019, but is transferred as heat energy. This\nraises the internal energy of the block and the\ntable. In winter, in order to feel warm, we\ngenerate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms\ntogether. We shall see later that the internal\nenergy is associated with the ceaseless, often\nrandom, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea\nof the transfer of heat energy is obtained by\nnoting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J\nof energy when it cools by10 \u00b0C.\n6.10.2   Chemical Energy\nOne of the greatest technical achievements of\nhumankind occurred when we discovered how\nto ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two\nflint stones together (mechanical energy), got\nthem to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves\n(chemical energy), which then provided\nsustained warmth.  A matchstick ignites into a\nbright flame when struck against a specially\nprepared chemical surface. The lighted\nmatchstick, when applied to a firecracker,\nresults in a spectacular display of sound and\nlight.Chemical energy arises from the fact that the\nmolecules participating in the chemical reaction\nhave different binding energies. A stable chemical\ncompound has less energy than the separated parts.\nA chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement\nof atoms. If the total energy of the reactants is more\nthan the products of the reaction, heat is released\nand the reaction is said to be an exothermic\nreaction. If the reverse is true , heat is absorbed and\nthe reaction is endothermic . Coal consists of\ncarbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases\nabout 3 \u00d7 107 J of energy.\nChemical energy is associated with the forces\nthat give rise to the stability of substances. These\nforces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into\npolymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy\narising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas,\nwood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily\nexistence.\n6.10.3  Electrical Energy\nThe flow of electrical current causes bulbs to\nglow, fans to rotate and bells to ring.  There are\nlaws governing the attraction and repulsion of\ncharges and currents, which we shall learn\nlater. Energy is associated with an electric\ncurrent. An urban Indian  household consumes\nabout 200 J of energy per second on an average.\n6.10.4  The Equivalence of Mass and Energy\nTill the end of the nineteenth century, physicists\nbelieved that in every physical and chemical\nprocess, the mass of an isolated system is\nconserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g.\nglacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but\nmatter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert\nEinstein (1879-1955) however, showed that mass\nand energy are equivalent and are related by\nthe relation\nE = m c2(6.20)\nwhere c, the speed of light in vacuum is\napproximately 3 \u00d7108 m s\u20131.  Thus, a staggering\namount of energy is associated with a mere\nkilogram of matter\nE = 1\u00d7 (3 \u00d7108)2 J = 9 \u00d71016 J.\nThis is equivalent to the annual electrical output\nof a large (3000 MW) power generating station.\n6.10.5  Nuclear Energy\nThe most destructive weapons made by man, the\nfission and fusion bombs are manifestations of\n2020-21",

On the other hand the explanation of the\nlife-nourishing energy output of the sun is also\nbased on the above equation.  In this case\neffectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form\na helium nucleus whose mass is less than the\nsum of the masses of the reactants. This mass\ndifference, called the mass defect \u2206m  is the\nsource of energy ( \u2206m)c2.  In fission, a hea vy\nnucleus like uranium U235\n92  , is split by a neutron\ninto lighter nuclei.

A person consuming 2400 calories a\nday will soon starve to death! 1 food calorie is\n1 kcal. /triangleleft\n6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of\nEnergy\nWe have seen that the total mechanical energy\nof the system is conserved if the forces doing work\non it are conservative. If some of the forces\ninvolved are non-conservative, part of the\nmechanical energy may get transformed into\nother forms such as heat, light and sound.\nHowever, the total energy of an isolated system\ndoes not change, as long as one accounts for all\nforms of energy.  Energy may be transformed from\none form to another but the total energy of an\nisolated system remains constant. Energy can\nneither be created, nor destroyed.\nSince the universe as a whole may be viewed\nas an isolated system, the total energy of the\nuniverse is constant. If one part of the universe\nloses energy, another part must gain an equal\namount of energy.\nThe principle of conservation of energy cannot\nbe proved. However, no violation of this principle\nhas been observed.  The concept of conservation\nand transformation of energy into various forms\nlinks together various branches of physics,\nchemistry and life sciences. It provides a\nunifying, enduring element in our scientific\npursuits. From engineering point of view all\nelectronic, communication and mechanical\ndevices rely on some forms of energy\ntransformation.\n6.11  POWER\nOften it is interesting to know not only the work\ndone on an object, but also the rate at which\nthis work is done. We say a person is physically\nfit if he not only climbs four floors of a building\nbut climbs them fast. Power is defined as the\ntime rate at which work is done or energy is\ntransferred.\nThe average power of a force is defined as the\nratio of the work, W, to the total time t takenPW\ntav=\nThe instantaneous power is defined as the\nlimiting value of the average power as time\ninterval approaches zero,\nd\ndWPt= (6.21)\nThe work dW done by a force F for a displacement\ndr is dW = F.dr.  The instantaneous power can\nalso be expressed as\nd\ndPt=F.r\n= F.v (6.22)\nwhere v is the instantaneous velocity when the\nforce is F.\nPower, like work and energy, is a scalar\nquantity.  Its dimensions are [ML2T\u20133]. In the SI,\nits unit is called a watt (W).  The watt is 1 J s\u20131.\nThe unit of power is named after James Watt,\none of the innovators of the steam engine in the\neighteenth century.\nThere is another unit of power, namely the\nhorse-power (hp)\n1 hp = 746 W\nThis unit is still used to describe the output of\nautomobiles, motorbikes, etc.\nWe encounter the unit watt when we buy\nelectrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and\nrefrigerators.  A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10\nhours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.\n100 (watt) \u00d7 10 (hour)\n= 1000 watt hour\n=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)\n= 103 (W) \u00d7 3600 (s)\n= 3.6 \u00d7 106 J\nOur electricity bills carry the energy\nconsumption in units of kWh.

The laws of momentum and energy\nconservation are typical examples. In this\nsection we shall apply these laws to a commonly\nencountered phenomena, namely collisions.\nSeveral games such as billiards, marbles or\ncarrom involve collisions.We shall study the\ncollision of two masses in an idealised form.\nConsider two masses m1 and m2.  The particle\nm1 is moving with speed v1i , the subscript \u2018i \u2019\nimplying initial. We can cosider m2  to be at rest.\nNo loss of generality is involved in making such\na selection. In this situation the  mass m1\ncollides  with  the stationary  mass m2  and  this\nis depicted in  Fig. 6.10.\nFig. 6. 10 Collision of mass m1, with a stationary mass m2.\nThe masses m1 and m2 fly-off in different\ndirections.  We shall see that there are\nrelationships, which connect the masses, the\nvelocities and the angles.\n6.12.1   Elastic and  Inelastic Collisions\nIn all collisions the total linear momentum is\nconserved; the initial momentum of the system\nis equal to the final momentum of the system.\nOne can argue this as follows.  When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time \u2206t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n\u2206p1 = F12  \u2206t\n\u2206p2 = F21  \u2206t\nwhere F12 is  the force exerted on the first particleby the second particle. F21 is likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton\u2019s third law, F12 = \u2212 F21.  This\nimplies\n\u2206p1 + \u2206p2 =  0\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time \u2206t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise  the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a \u2018compressed spring \u2019. If\nthe \u2018spring \u2019 connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy , then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time \u2206t is not constant. Such a collision\nis called an elastic collision . On the other hand\nthe deformation may not be relieved and the two\nbodies could move together after the collision. A\ncollision in which the two particles move together\nafter the collision is called a completely inelastic\ncollision . The intermediate case where the\ndeformation is partly relieved and some of the\ninitial kinetic energy is lost is more common and\nis appropriately called an inelastic collision .\n6.12.2   Collisions in One Dimension\nConsider first a completely inelastic collision\nin one dimension.

Two, if two bodies\nof different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision\nunless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly\ndifficult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision.\nBy performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take\ntwo balls, one of which is heavier (basketball/football/volleyball) and the other lighter (tennis\nball/rubber ball/table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from\nsome height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the floor or ground,\njust before and just after the bounce (by using 22v gh= ). Hence you\nwill get the coefficient of restitution.\nNow take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your\nhands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter\none, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain\ntogether while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the\nheavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the\nlighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to\nhold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and\ndoes not fly sideways. This is head-on collision.\nYou can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you\nthe best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance.\nWe leave it to you to think how you can determine the initial and\nfinal velocities of the balls.\n2020-21",

In the case of small spherical\nbodies, this is possible if the direction of travel\nof body 1 passes through the centre of body 2\nwhich is at rest. In general, the collision is two-\ndimensional, where the initial velocities and the\nfinal velocities lie in a plane.6.12.3  Collisions in Two Dimensions\nFig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving\nmass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear\nmomentum is conserved in such a collision.\nSince momentum is a vector this implies three\nequations for the three directions { x, y, z }.\nConsider the plane determined by the final\nvelocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to\nbe the x-y plane. The conservation of the\nz-component of the linear momentum implies\nthat the entire collision is in the x-y plane. The\nx- and y-component equations are\nm1v1i = m1v1f cos \u03b8 1 + m2v2f cos \u03b8 2     (6.29)\n0  = m1v1f  sin \u03b81 \u2212  m2v2f sin \u03b82        (6.30)\nOne knows { m1, m2, v1i} in most situations.  There\nare thus four unknowns { v1f, v2f, \u03b81 and \u03b82}, and\nonly two equations. If \u03b8 1 = \u03b8 2 = 0, we regain\nEq.

That still\nleaves us one equation short.  At least one of\nthe four unknowns, say \u03b8 1, must be made known\nfor the problem to be solvable. For example, \u03b81\ncan be determined by moving a detector in an\nangular fashion from the x  to the y  axis. Given\n{m1, m2, v1i, \u03b81} we can determine { v1f, v2f, \u03b82}\nfrom Eqs.

This is what happens\nin the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.\nIn our everyday world, collisions take place only\nwhen two bodies touch each other. But consider\na comet coming from far distances to the sun, or\nalpha particle coming towards a nucle us and\ngoing away in some direction. Here we have to\ndeal with forces involving action at a distance.\nSuch an event is called scattering. The velocities\nand directions in which the two particles go away\ndepend on their initial velocities as well as the\ntype of interaction between them, their masses,\nshapes and sizes.\nSUMMARY\n1.The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work\ndone by the net force on the body.\nKf - Ki = Wnet\n2.A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and\ndepends only on the end points { xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an\narbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.\n3.For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)\nsuch that\nF xV x\nx( )= \u2212( )d\nd\nor V V = F x  xi f\nxx\nif\n\u2212 () \u222bd\n4.The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical\nenergy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.\n5.The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth\u2019s\nsurface is\nV(x) = m g x\nwhere the variation of g with height is ignored.\n6.The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k  and extension x is\nV x    k x()=1\n22\n7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar\nquantity given by : A.B = AB cos \u03b8,  where \u03b8  is the angle between A and B.  It can be\npositive, negative or zero depending upon the value of \u03b8. The scalar product of two\nvectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component\nof the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors :\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6i i j j k k\u22c5 = \u22c5 = \u22c5 = 1 and \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6i j j k k i\u22c5 = \u22c5 = \u22c5 = 0\nScalar products obey the commutative and  the distributive laws.\n2020-21",

    "content": "WORK, ENERGY AND POWER 133\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.The phrase \u2018calculate the work done\u2019 is incomplete. We should refer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n2.Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n3.For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton\u2019s Third Law,\nF12  +  F21  =  0\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\nW12  + W21  \u2260  0\nHowever, it  may sometimes be true.\n4.The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 6.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n5.The WE theorem is not independent of Newton\u2019s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n6.The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n7.The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mg h,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n8.Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n9.During a collision  : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of\nthe collision  ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)\napplies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.\nIn fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may  be momentarily at rest\nwith respect to each other.\n2020-21",

A woman standing with a very heavy load on\nher head may get very tired.  But no mechanical work is involved.\nThat is not to say that mechanical work cannot be estimated in\nordinary human activity.\nConsider a person walking with constant speed v0. The mechanical work he does may be estimated simply\nwith the help of the work-energy theorem. Assume :\n(a)The major work done in walking is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the legs with each stride\n(See Fig. 6.20).\n(b)Neglect air resistance.\n(c)Neglect the small work done in lifting the legs against gravity.\n(d)Neglect the swinging of hands etc. as is common in walking.\nAs we can see in Fig. 6.20, in each stride the leg is brought from rest to a speed, approximately equal to the\nspeed of walking, and then brought to rest again.\nFig. 6.20 An illustration of a single stride in walking. While the first leg is maximally off the round, the second leg\nis on the ground and vice-versa\nThe work done by one leg in each stride is 2\n0 lv  m  by the work-energy theorem. Here  ml  is the mass of the leg.\nNote 2 /2\n0 lv  m  energy is expended by one set of leg muscles to bring the foot from rest to speed v0 while an\nadditional 2 /2\n0 lv  m   is expended by a complementary set of leg muscles to bring the foot to rest from speed  v0.\nHence work done by both legs in one stride is (study Fig. 6.20 carefully)\n2\n0 l sv  m W2= (6.34)\nAssuming mass of the leg ml\u00a0= 10 kg and slow running with a speed of 10 km in a hour which translates to\napproximately 3 m s-1, we obtain\nWs=180 J/stride\nIf we take a stride to be 2 m long, the person covers 1.5 strides per second at his speed of  3 m s-1.  Thus the\npower expended\n     \n        =  270 W\nWe must bear in mind that this is a lower estimate since several avenues of power loss (e.g. swinging of hands,\nair resistance etc.) have been ignored.  The interesting point is that we did not worry about the forces involved.\nThe forces, mainly friction and those exerted on the leg by the muscles of the rest of the body, are hard to\nestimate. Static friction does no work and we bypassed the impossible task of estimating the work done by the\nmuscles by taking r ecourse to the work-ener gy theor em. W e can also see the advantage of a wheel. The wheel\npermits smooth locomotion without the continual starting and stopping in mammalian locomotion.\n2020-21",

(A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  W e applied the r esults of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\nAny r eal body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  W e shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  W e shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centr e\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept her e.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centr e of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\nA lar ge class of pr oblems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a per fectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change.  It is evident fr om\nthis definition of a rigid body that no r eal body is truly rigid,\nsince r eal bodies defor m under the influence of for ces. But in\nmany situations the defor mations ar e negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignor e\nthat they warp  (twist out of shape) , bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid.\n7.1.1  What kind of motion can a rigid body have?\nLet us try to explor e this question by taking some examples\nof the motion of rigid bodies.

Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body are moving together,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 7.1).\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\nConsider now the rolling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n7.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus \u2018something else.\u2019\nIn order to understand what this \u2018something\nelse\u2019 is, let us take a rigid body so constrained\nthat it cannot have translational motion.  Themost common way to constrain a rigid body so\nthat it does not have translational motion is to\nfix it along a straight line. The only possible\nmotion of such a rigid body is rotation . The line\nor fixed axis about which the body is rotating is\nits axis of rotation. If you look around, you will\ncome across many examples of rotation about\nan axis, a ceiling fan, a potter\u2019s wheel, a giant\nwheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig\n7.3(a) and (b)).\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.3 Rotation about a fixed axis\n(a) A ceiling fan\n(b) A potter\u2019s wheel .\nLet us try to understand what rotation is,\nwhat characterises rotation.

Fig. 7.4 shows\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis (the z -axis of the frame of reference).  Let P1\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\nand at a distance r1 from fixed axis.  The particle\nP1 describes a circle of radius  r1 with its centre\nC1 on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\nanother particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a\ndistance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P2\nmoves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2\non the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles\ndescribed by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;\nboth these planes, however, are perpendicular\nto the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis\nlike P3, r = 0. Any such particle remains\nstationary while the body rotates.  This is\nexpected since the axis of rotation is fixed.Fig. 7.5 (a) A spinning top\n(The point of contact of the top with the\nground, its tip O, is fixed.)\nFig. 7.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating\nblades.

Thus, in more\ngeneral cases of rotation, such as the rotation\nof a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not\none line,  of the rigid body is fixed. In this case\nthe axis is not fixed, though it always passes\nthrough the fixed point. In our study, however,\nwe mostly deal with the simpler and special case\nof rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis\nonly unless stated otherwise.\nThe rolling motion of a cylinder down an\ninclined plane is a combination of rotation about\na fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the\n\u2018something else\u2019 in the case of rolling motion\nwhich we referred to earlier is rotational motion.\nYou will find Fig. 7.6(a) and (b) instructive from\nthis point of view. Both these figures show\nmotion of the same body along identical\ntranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7.6(a),\nthe motion is a pure translation; in the other\ncase [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of\ntranslation and rotation. (You may try to\nreproduce the two types of motion shown, using\na rigid object like a heavy book.)\nWe now recapitulate the most important\nobservations of the present section: The motion\nof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in\nsome way is either a pure translation or a\ncombination of translation and rotation. The\nmotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed\nin some way is rotation.   The rotation may be\nabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or\nmoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.7.5(b)] ).\nWe shall, in the present chapter, consider\nrotational motion about a fixed axis only.\n7.2  CENTRE OF MASS\nWe shall first see what the centre of mass of a\nsystem of particles is and then discuss its\nsignificance. For simplicity we shall start with\na two particle system. We shall take the line\njoining the two particles to be the x- axis.\nFig. 7.7\nLet the distances of the two particles be x1\nand x2 respectively from some origin O. Let m1\nand m2 be respectively the masses of the twoFig. 7.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure\ntranslation.\nFig. 7.6(b)  Motion of a rigid body which is a\ncombination of translation and\nrotation.\nFig 7.6 (a) and 7.6 (b) illustrate different motions of\nthe same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the\nbody; O is the centre of mass of the body, which is\ndefined in the next section. Suffice to say here that\nthe trajectories of O are the translational trajectories\nTr1 and Tr2 of the body. The positions O and P at\nthree different instants of time are shown by O1, O2,\nand O3, and P1, P2 and P3, respectively, in both\nFigs. 7.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 7.6(a), at any\ninstant the velocities of any particles like O and P of\nthe body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in\nthis case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes\nwith a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains\nthe same, i.e. \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13. Fig. 7.6 (b) illustrates a\ncase of combination of translation and rotation. In\nthis case, at any instants the velocities of O and P\ndiffer. Also, \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 may all be different.\n2020-21",

By using symmetry\nconsideration, we can easily show that the\ncentres of mass of these bodies lie at their\ngeometric centres.Let us consider a thin rod, whose width and\nbreath (in case the cross section of the rod is\nrectangular) or radius (in case the cross section\nof the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than\nits length. Taking the origin to be at the\ngeometric centre of the rod and x-axis to be\nalong the length of the rod, we can say that on\naccount of reflection symmetry, for every\nelement dm of the rod at x, there is an element\nof the same mass dm located at \u2013 x (Fig. 7.8).\nThe net contribution of every such pair to\nthe integral and hence the integral  itself\nis zero.  From Eq. (7.6), the point for which the\nintegral  itself is zero, is the centre of mass.\nThus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin\nrod coincides with its geometric centre. This can\nbe understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.\nThe same symmetry argument will apply to\nhomogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even\nthick rods of circular or rectangular cross\nsection. For all such bodies you will realise that\nfor every element  dm at a point ( x, y, z) one can\nalways take an element of the same mass at\nthe point (\u2013 x, \u2013y, \u2013 z). (In other words, the origin\nis a point of reflection symmetry for these\nbodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (7.5 a)\nall are zero. This means that for all the above\nbodies, their centre of mass coincides with their\ngeometric centre.\nExample 7.1  Find the centre of mass of\nthree particles at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle.

How will you\nthen determine the centre of mass of the lamina?\n/triangleleft\n7.3  MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS\nEquipped with the definition of the centre of\nmass, we are now in a position to discuss its\nphysical importance for a system of n particles.\nWe may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as\n1 1 2 2 ...i i n n M m m m m = = + + +\u2211R r r r r (7.7)\nDifferentiating the two sides of the equation\nwith respect to time we get\n1 2\n1 2d d d d...d d dn\nn M m m mt t t dt= + + +r r r R\nor\n1 1 2 2 ...n n M m m m = + + +V v v v (7.8)\nwhere  ( )1 1d /d t =v r  is the velocity of the first\nparticle ( )2 2d dt=v r is the velocity of the\nsecond particle etc. and d /d t =V R  is the\nvelocity of the centre of mass. Note that we\nassumed the masses m1, m2, ... etc. do not\nchange in time. We have therefore, treated them\nas constants in differentiating the equations\nwith respect to time.\nDifferentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time,\nwe obtain\n1 2\n1 2d d d d...d d d dn\nn M m m mt t t t= + + +v v v V\nor\n1 1 2 2 ...n n M m m m = + + +A a a a (7.9)\nwhere ( )1 1d /d t =a v  is the acceleration of the\nfirst particle,  ( )2 2d /d t =a v  is the acceleration\nof the second particle etc. and  ( ) d /d t =A V  is\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\nsystem of particles.\nNow, from Newton\u2019s second law, the force\nacting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .\nThe force acting on the second particle is given\nby 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written\nas\n1 2 ...n M = + + +A F F F (7.10)Thus, the total mass of a system of particles\ntimes the acceleration of its centre of mass is\nthe vector sum of all the forces acting on the\nsystem of particles.\nNote when we talk of the force 1Fon the first\nparticle, it is not a single force, but the vector\nsum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise\nfor the second particle etc. Among these forces\non each particle there will be external  forces\nexerted by bodies outside the system and also\ninternal  forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother. We know from Newton\u2019s third law that\nthese internal forces occur in equal and opposite\npairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10),\ntheir contribution is zero. Only the external\nforces contribute to the equation. We can then\nrewrite Eq. (7.10) as\next M =A F (7.11)\nwhere extF represents the sum of all external\nforces acting on the particles of the system.\nEq. (7.11) states that the centre of mass\nof a system of particles moves as if all the\nmass of the  system was concentrated at the\ncentre of mass and all the external forces\nwere applied at that point.\nNotice, to determine the motion of the centre\nof mass no knowledge of internal forces of the\nsystem of particles is required; for this purpose\nwe need to know only the external forces.\nTo obtain Eq. (7.11) we did not need to\nspecify the nature of the system of particles.\nThe system may be a collection of particles in\nwhich there may be all kinds of internal\nmotions, or it may be a rigid body which has\neither pure translational motion or a\ncombination of translational and rotational\nmotion. Whatever is the system and the motion\nof its individual particles, the centre of mass\nmoves according to Eq. (7.11).\nInstead of treating extended bodies as single\nparticles as we have done in earlier chapters,\nwe can now treat them as systems of particles.\nWe can obtain the translational component of\ntheir motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass\nof the system, by taking the mass of the whole\nsystem to be concentrated at the centre of mass\nand all the external forces on the system to be\nacting at the centre of mass.\nThis is the procedure that we followed earlier\nin analysing forces on bodies and solving\n2020-21",

We now realise that in\nearlier studies we assumed, without saying so,\nthat rotational motion and/or internal motion\nof the particles were either absent or negligible.\nWe no longer need to do this. We have not only\nfound the justification of the procedure we\nfollowed earlier; but we also have found how to\ndescribe and separate the translational motion\nof (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as\nwell,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds\nof internal motion.\nFig. 7.12 The centre of mass of the fragments\nof the projectile continues along the\nsame parabolic path which it would\nhave followed if there were no\nexplosion.\nFigure 7.12 is a good illustration of Eq.\n(7.11). A projectile, following the usual parabolic\ntrajectory, explodes into fragments midway in\nair. The forces leading to the explosion are\ninternal forces. They contribute nothing to the\nmotion of the centre of mass. The total external\nforce, namely, the force of gravity acting on the\nbody, is the same before and after the explosion.\nThe centre of mass under the influence of the\nexternal force continues, therefore, along the\nsame parabolic trajectory as it would have\nfollowed if there were no explosion.\n7.4LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF\nPARTICLES\nLet us recall that the linear momentum of a\nparticle is defined as\nm=p v (7.12)\nLet us also recall that Newton\u2019s second law\nwritten in symbolic form for a single particle is\nd\ndt=pF (7.13)where F is the force on the particle. Let us\nconsider a system of n particles with masses m1,\nm2,...mn respectively and velocities 1 2, ,.......n v v v\nrespectively. The particles may be interacting\nand have external forces acting on them. The\nlinear momentum of the first particle is 1 1mv,\nof the second particle is 2 2mv and so on.\nFor the system of n particles, the linear\nmomentum of the system is defined to be the\nvector sum of all individual particles of the\nsystem,\n1 2 ...n = + + +P p p p\n1 1 2 2 ...n n m m m= + + +v v v (7.14)\nComparing this with Eq. (7.8)\nM=P V (7.15)\nThus, the total momentum of a system\nof particles is equal to the product of the\ntotal mass of the system and the velocity of\nits centre of mass . Differentiating Eq. (7.15)\nwith respect to time,\nd d\nd dM Mt t= =P VA (7.16)\nComparing Eq.(7.16) and Eq. (7.11),\nd\ndextt=PF (7.17)\nThis is the statement of  Newton\u2019s second law\nof motion extended to a system of particles.\nSuppose now, that the sum of external\nforces acting on a system of particles is zero.\nThen from Eq.(7.17)\nord0dt=PP = Constant (7.18a)\nThus, when the total external force acting\non a system of particles is zero, the total linear\nmomentum of the system is constant. This is\nthe law of conservation of the total linear\nmomentum of a system of particles. Because of\nEq. (7.15), this also means that when the\ntotal external force on the system is zero\nthe velocity of the centre of mass remains\nconstant. (We assume throughout the\ndiscussion on systems of particles in this\nchapter that the total mass of the system\nremains constant.)\nNote that on account of the internal forces,\ni.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother, the individual particles may have\n2020-21",

Yet, if the total external\nforce acting on the system is zero, the centre of\nmass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves\nuniformly in a straight line like a free particle.\nThe vector Eq. (7.18a) is equivalent to three\nscalar equations,\nPx = c1, Py = c2 and Pz = c3(7.18 b)\nHere Px, Py and Pz are the components of the\ntotal linear momentum vector P along the x\u2013, y\u2013\nand z\u2013axes respectively; c1, c2 and c3 are\nconstants.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 7.13 (a) A heavy nucleus radium (Ra) splits into\na lighter nucleus radon (Rn) and an alpha\nparticle (nucleus of hel ium atom). The CM\nof the system is in uniform motion.\n(b)The same spliting of the heavy nucleus\nradium (Ra) with the centre of mass at\nrest. The two product particles fly back\nto back.\nAs an example, let us consider the\nradioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,\nlike the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus\ndisintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an\nalpha particle. The forces leading to the decay\nare internal to the system and the external\nforces on the system are negligible. So the total\nlinear momentum of the system is the same\nbefore and after decay. The two particles\nproduced in the decay, the radon nucleus and\nthe alpha particle, move in different directions\nin such a way that their centre of mass moves\nalong the same path along which the original\ndecaying radium nucleus was moving\n[Fig. 7.13(a)].\nIf we observe the decay from the frame of\nreference in which the centre of mass is at rest,\nthe motion of the particles involved in the decay\nlooks particularly simple; the product particlesmove back to back with their centre of mass\nremaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b).\nIn many problems on the system of\nparticles , as in the above radioactive decay\nproblem, it is convenient to work in the centre\nof mass frame rather than in the laboratory\nframe of reference.\nIn astronomy, binary (double) stars is a\ncommon occurrence. If there are no external\nforces, the centre of mass of a double star\nmoves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7.14\n(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal\nmass are also shown in the figure; they look\ncomplicated. If we go to the centre of mass\nframe, then we find that there the two stars\nare moving in a circle, about the centre of\nmass, which is at rest. Note that the position\nof the stars have to be diametrically opposite\nto each other [Fig. 7.14(b) ]. Thus  in our frame\nof reference,  the trajectories of the stars are a\ncombination of (i) uniform motion in a straight\nline of the centre of mass and (ii) circular\norbits of the stars about the centre of mass.\nAs can be seen from the two examples,\nseparating  the motion of different parts of a\nsystem into motion of the centre of mass and\nmotion about the centre of mass  is a very\nuseful technique that helps in understanding\nthe motion of the system.\n7.5  VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS\nWe are already familiar with vectors and their\nuse in physics. In chapter 6 (Work, Energy,\nPower) we defined the scalar product of two\nvectors. An important physical quantity, work,\nis defined as a scalar product of two vector\nquantities, force and displacement.(a) (b)\nFig. 7.14 (a)Trajectories of two stars, S1 (dotted\nline) and S2 (solid line) forming a\nbinary system with their centre of\nmass C in uniform motion.\n(b)The same binary system, with the\ncentre of mass C at rest.\n2020-21",

Two important\nquantities in the study of rotational motion,\nnamely, moment of a force and angular\nmomentum, are defined as vector products.\nDefinition of Vector Product\nA vector product of two vectors a and b is a\nvector c such that\n(i)magnitude of c = c sinab \u03b8 =  where a and b\nare magnitudes of  a and b and \u03b8 is the\nangle between the two vectors.\n(ii)c is perpendicular to the plane containing\na and b.\n(iii)if we take a right handed screw with its head\nlying in the plane of  a and b and the screw\nperpendicular to this plane, and if we turn\nthe head in the direction from  a to b, then\nthe tip of the screw advances in the direction\nof c. This right handed screw rule is\nillustrated in Fig. 7.15a.\nAlternately, if one curls up the fingers of\nright hand around a line perpendicular to the\nplane of the vectors  a and b and if the fingers\nare curled up in the direction from a to b, then\nthe stretched thumb points in the direction of\nc, as shown in Fig. 7.15b.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for\ndefining the direction of the vector\nproduct of two vectors.\n                (b) Rule of the right hand for defining the\ndirection of the vector product.A simpler version of the right hand rule is\nthe following : Open up your right hand palm\nand curl the fingers pointing from  a to b. Your\nstretched thumb points in the direction of c.\nIt should be remembered that there are two\nangles between any two vectors  a and b . In\nFig. 7.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to \u03b8 (as\nshown) and (3600\u2013 \u03b8). While applying either of\nthe above rules, the rotation should be taken\nthrough the smaller angle (<1800) between  a\nand b. It is \u03b8 here.\nBecause of the cross (\u00d7) used to denote the\nvector product, it is also referred to as cross product.\n\u2022Note that scalar product of two vectors is\ncommutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a\nThe vector product, however, is not\ncommutative, i.e. a \u00d7 b \u2260 b \u00d7 a\nThe magnitude of both a \u00d7 b and b \u00d7 a is the\nsame ( sinab \u03b8); also, both of them are\nperpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the\nrotation of the right-handed screw in case of\na \u00d7 b  is from  a to b, whereas in case of  b \u00d7 a it\nis from b to a. This means the two vectors are\nin opposite directions. We have\n\u00d7 = \u2212 \u00d7a b b a\n\u2022Another interesting property of a vector\nproduct is its behaviour under reflection.\nUnder reflection (i.e. on taking the plane\nmirror image) we have\nand , x x y y z z\u2192 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 . As a result all\nthe components of a vector change sign and\nthus , a a\u2192 \u2212 b b\u2192 \u2212 .

For this we first need to obtain some\nelementary cross products:\n(i) a \u00d7 a = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector\nwith zero magnitude)\nThis follows since magnitude of a \u00d7 a  is\n2sin0 0a \u00b0 =.\n2020-21",

We\nhave seen that every particle of a rotating body\nmoves in a circle. The linear velocity of the\nparticle is related to the angular velocity. The\nrelation between these two quantities involves\na vector product which we learnt about in the\nlast section.\nLet us go back to Fig. 7.4. As said above, in\nrotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,\nFig. 7.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle ( P)\nof the rigid body rotating about the fixed\n(z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)\non the axis.)\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis.

We also show the\nlinear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is\nalong the tangent at P to the circle.\nLet P \u2032 be the position of the particle after an\ninterval of time \u2206t (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP \u2032\ndescribes the angular displacement \u2206\u03b8 of the\nparticle in time \u2206t. The average angular velocity\nof the particle over the interval  \u2206t is \u2206\u03b8/\u2206t. As\n\u2206t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller\nvalues), the ratio \u2206\u03b8/\u2206t approaches a limit which\nis the instantaneous angular velocity d \u03b8/dt of\nthe particle at the position P. We denote the\ninstantaneous angular velocity by  \u03c9 (the\nGreek letter omega). We know from our study\nof circular motion that the magnitude of linear\nvelocity  v of a particle moving in a circle is\nrelated to the angular velocity of the particle \u03c9\nby the simple relation r \u03c5 \u03c9=, where r is the\nradius of the circle.\nWe observe that at any given instant the\nrelation  v r\u03c9= applies to  all particles of the\nrigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular\ndistance ri  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity\nat a given instant vi is given by\ni iv r \u03c9= (7.19)\nThe index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the\ntotal number of particles of the body.\nFor particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence\nv = \u03c9 r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are\nstationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.\nNote that we use the same angular velocity\n\u03c9 for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9\nas the angular velocity of the whole body .\nWe have characterised pure translation of\na body by all parts of the body having the same\nvelocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we\nmay characterise pure rotation by all parts of\nthe body having the same angular velocity at\nany instant of time . Note that this\ncharacterisation of the rotation of a rigid body\nabout a fixed axis is just another way  of saying\nas in Sec. 7.1 that each particle of the body moves\nin a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular\nto the axis and has the centre on the axis.\nIn our discussion so far the angular velocity\nappears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We\nshall not justify this fact, but we shall accept\nit. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular\nvelocity vector lies along the axis of rotation,and points out in the direction in which a right\nhanded screw would advance, if the head of the\nscrew is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7.17a).\nThe magnitude of this vector is d dt\u03c9 \u03b8=\nreferred as above.\nFig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw\nrotates with the body, the screw\nadvances in the direction of the angular\nvelocity \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9. If the sense (clockwise or\nanticlockwise) of rotation of the body\nchanges, so does the direction of \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9.\nFig. 7.17 (b) The angular velocity vector \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 is\ndirected along the fixed axis as shown.\nThe linear velocity of the particle at P\nis v = \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u00d7 r. It is  perpendicular to both\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 and r and is  directed along the\ntangent to the circle described by the\nparticle.\nWe shall now look at what the vector product\n\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u00d7 r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7.17(b) which\nis a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the\npath of the particle P. The figure shows the\nvector \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 directed along the fixed ( z\u2013) axis and\nalso the position vector  r = OP of the particle\nat P of the rigid body with respect to the origin\nO.

It is\ntherefore, along the tangent to the circle at P.\nAlso, the magnitude of  \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u00d7 CP is \u03c9 (CP) since\n\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 and CP are perpendicular to each other. We\nshall denote CP by \u22a5r and not by r, as we did\nearlier.\nThus, \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u00d7 r is a vector of magnitude \u03c9r\u22a5\nand is along the tangent to the circle described\nby the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v\nat P has the same magnitude and direction.\nThus,\nv = \u03c9  \u03c9 \u03c9  \u03c9 \u03c9 \u00d7 r (7.20)\nIn fact, the relation, Eq. (7.20), holds good\neven for rotation of a rigid body with one point\nfixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 7.6(a)].\nIn this case r represents the position vector of\nthe particle with respect to the fixed point taken\nas the origin.\nWe note that for rotation about a fixed\naxis, the direction of the vector \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 does not\nchange with time. Its magnitude may,\nhowever, change from instant to instant. For\nthe more general rotation, both the\nmagnitude and the direction of \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 may change\nfrom instant to instant.\n7.6.1  Angular acceleration\nYou may have noticed that we are developing\nthe study of rotational motion along the lines\nof the study of translational motion with which\nwe are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic\nvariables of linear displacement (s) and velocity\n(v) in translational motion, we have angular\ndisplacement ( \u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b8) and angular velocity ( \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9) in\nrotational motion. It is then natural to define\nin rotational motion the concept of angular\nacceleration in analogy with linear acceleration\ndefined as the time rate of change of velocity in\ntranslational motion. We define angular\nacceleration \u03b1 \u03b1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b1 as the time rate of change of\nangular velocity; Thus,\nd\ndt=\u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9\u03b1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b1 (7.21)If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction\nof \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 and hence, that of \u03b1 \u03b1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b1 is fixed. In this case\nthe vector equation reduces to a scalar equation\nd\ndt\u03c9\u03b1= (7.22)\n7.7  TORQUE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM\nIn this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with\ntwo physical quantities  (torque and angular\nmomentum)  which are defined as vector products\nof two vectors. These as we shall see, are\nespecially important in the discussion of motion\nof systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.\n7.7.1  Moment of force (Torque)\nWe have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,\nin general, is a combination of rotation and\ntranslation. If the body is fixed at a point or along\na line, it has only rotational motion. We know\nthat force is needed to change the translational\nstate of a body, i.e. to produce linear\nacceleration. We may then ask, what is the\nanalogue of force in the case of rotational\nmotion? To look into the question in a concrete\nsituation let us take the example of opening or\nclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body which\ncan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing\nthrough the hinges. What makes the door\nrotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied\nthe door does not rotate. But any force does not\ndo the job. A force applied to the hinge line\ncannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a\nforce of given magnitude applied at right angles\nto the door at its outer edge is most effective in\nproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, but\nhow and where the force is applied is important\nin rotational motion.\nThe rotational analogue of force in linear\nmotion is moment of force . It is also referred to\nas torque or couple . (We shall use the words\nmoment of force and torque interchangeably.)\nWe shall first define the moment of force for the\nspecial case of a single particle. Later on we\nshall extend the concept to systems of particles\nincluding rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to\na change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is\nangular acceleration of a rigid body.\n2020-21",

It is, however, a very different physical\nquantity than work. Moment of a force is a\nvector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of\nmoment of force is newton metre (N m). The\nmagnitude of the moment of force may be\nwritten\n( sin )r F r F \u03c4 \u03b8\u22a5 = = (7.24b)\nor sinr F rF\u03c4 \u03b8\u22a5 = = (7.24c)\nwhere r\u22a5 = r sin\u03b8 is the perpendicular distanceof the line of action of F from the origin and\n( sin )F F \u03b8\u22a5= is the component of F in the\ndirection perpendicular to r. Note that \u03c4 = 0 if\nr = 0, F = 0 or \u03b8 = 00 or 1800 .

If directions of both r and F are\nreversed, the direction of the moment of force\nremains the same.\n7.7.2  Angular momentum of a particle\nJust as the moment of a force is the rotational\nanalogue of force in linear motion, the quantity\nangular momentum is the rotational analogue\nof linear momentum. We shall first define\nangular momentum for the special case of a\nsingle particle and look at its usefulness in the\ncontext of single particle motion. We shall then\nextend the definition of angular momentum to\nsystems of particles including rigid bodies.\nLike moment of a force, angular momentum\nis also a vector product. It could also be referred\nto as moment of (linear) momentum. From this\nterm one could guess how angular momentum\nis defined.\nConsider a particle of mass m and linear\nmomentum p at a position r relative to the origin\nO. The angular momentum l of the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined to be\nl = r \u00d7  \u00d7  \u00d7  \u00d7  \u00d7 p (7.25a)\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum\nvector is\nsin l r p= \u03b8 (7.26a)\nwhere p is the magnitude of p and \u03b8 is the angle\nbetween r and p.

We expect the angular\nmomentum to be zero ( l = 0), if the linear\nmomentum vanishes ( p = 0), if the particle is at\nthe origin ( r = 0), or if the directional line of  p\npasses through the origin \u03b8 = 00 or 1800.\n2020-21",

    "content": "SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 159\nEq. (7.31a) and (7.31b) give six independent\nconditions to be satisfied for mechanical\nequilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of\nproblems all the forces acting on the body are\ncoplanar. Then we need only three conditions\nto be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two\nof these conditions correspond to translational\nequilibrium; the sum of the components of the\nforces along any two perpendicular axes in the\nplane must be zero. The third condition\ncorresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum\nof the components of the torques along any axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the forces must\nbe zero.\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body\nmay be compared with those for a particle,\nwhich we considered in earlier chapters. Since\nconsideration of rotational motion does not\napply to a particle, only the conditions for\ntranslational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to\na particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle\nthe vector sum of all the forces on it must be\nzero. Since all these forces act on the single\nparticle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium\nunder concurrent forces was discussed in the\nearlier chapters.\nA body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it\nmay be in translational equilibrium and not in\nrotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational\nequilibrium and not in translational\nequilibrium.\nConsider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod\n(AB) as shown in Fig. 7.20(a). At the two ends (A\nand B) of which two parallel forces, both  equal\nin magnitude and acting along same direction\nare applied perpendicular to the rod.\nFig. 7.20 (a)\nLet C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.\nthe moment of the forces at A and B will both\nbe equal in magnitude ( aF), but opposite in\nsense as shown. The net moment on the rod will\nbe zero. The system will be in rotational\nequilibrium, but it will not be in translational\nequilibrium; F 0\u2260\u2211Fig. 7.20 (b)\nThe force at B in Fig. 7.20(a) is reversed in\nFig. 7.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with\ntwo forces of equal magnitude but acting in\nopposite diretions applied perpendicular to the\nrod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here\nthe moments of both the forces are equal, but\nthey are not opposite; they act in the same sense\nand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The\ntotal force on the body is zero; so the body is in\ntranslational equilibrium; but it is not in\nrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not\nfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.\nrotation without translation).\nA pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting\nin opposite directions with different lines of\naction is known as a couple or torque . A couple\nproduces rotation without translation.\nWhen we open the lid of a bottle by turning\nit, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid\n[Fig. 7.21(a)]. Another known example is a\ncompass needle in the earth\u2019s magnetic field as\nshown in the Fig. 7.21(b). The earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield exerts equal forces on the north and south\npoles. The force on the North Pole is towards\nthe north, and the force on the South Pole is\ntoward the south. Except when the needle points\nin the north-south direction; the two forces do\nnot have the same line of action. Thus there is\na couple  acting on the needle due to the earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field.\nFig. 7.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn\nthe lid.\n2020-21",

The forces F and - F act\nrespectively at points B and A. These points have\nposition vectors r1 and r2 with respect to origin\nO. Let us take the moments of the forces about\nthe origin.\nThe moment of the couple = sum of the\nmoments of the two forces making the couple\n= r1 \u00d7 (\u2013F) + r2 \u00d7 F\n= r2 \u00d7 F \u2013 r1 \u00d7 F\n= (r2\u2013r1) \u00d7 F\nBut r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 \u2013 r1.\nThe moment of the couple, therefore, is\nAB \u00d7 F.\nClearly this is independent of the origin, the\npoint about which we took the moments of the\nforces. /triangleleft\n7.8.1  Principle of moments\nAn ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of\nnegligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along itslength. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-\nsaw on the children\u2019s playground is a typical\nexample of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel\nto each other and usually perpendicular to the\nlever, as shown here, act on the lever at\ndistances d1 and d2 respectively from the\nfulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23.\nFig. 7.23\nThe lever is a system in mechanical\nequilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support\nat the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the\nforces  F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium,\nR \u2013 F1 \u2013 F2 = 0 (i)\nFor considering rotational equilibrium we\ntake the moments about the fulcrum; the sum\nof moments must be zero,\nd1F1 \u2013 d2F2 = 0 (ii)\nNormally the anticlockwise (clockwise)\nmoments are taken to be positive (negative). Note\nR acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment\nabout the fulcrum.\nIn the case of the lever force F1 is usually\nsome weight to be lifted. It is called the load\nand its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called\nthe load arm . Force F2 is the effort  applied to lift\nthe load; distance  d2 of the effort from the\nfulcrum is the effort arm.\nEq. (ii) can be written as\nd1F1 = d2 F2(7.32a)\nor load arm \u00d7 load = effort arm \u00d7 effort\nThe above equation expresses the principle\nof moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio\nF1/F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);\nM.A. =1 2\n2 1F d\nF d=(7.32b)\nIf the effort arm d2 is larger than the load\narm, the mechanical advantage is greater than\none. Mechanical advantage greater than one\nmeans that a small effort can be used to lift a\nlarge load. There are several examples of a lever\naround you besides the see-saw.

Take an irregular-\nshaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow\ntipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial\nand error a point G on the cardboard where it\ncan be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The\ncardboard remains horizontal in this position.)\nThis point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)\nof the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides\na vertically upward force due to which the\ncardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As\nshown in the Fig. 7.24, the reaction of the tip is\nequal and opposite to Mg and hence the\ncardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is\nalso in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,\ndue to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and\nfall. There are torques on the card board due to\nthe forces of gravity like m1g, m2g \u2026.  etc, acting\non the individual particles that make up the\ncardboard.\nFig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a\npencil. The point of support, G, is the\ncentre of gravity.The CG of the cardboard is so located that\nthe total torque on it due to the forces m1g, m2g\n\u2026.  etc. is zero.\nIf  ri is the position vector of the ith particle\nof an extended body with respect to its CG, then\nthe torque about the CG, due to the force of\ngravity on the particle  is \u03c4 \u03c4\u03c4 \u03c4\u03c4i = ri \u00d7 mi g. The total\ngravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.\n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4gii im = = \u00d7 =\u2211 \u2211 r g 0 (7.33)\nWe may therefore, define the CG of a body\nas that point where the total gravitational torque\non the body is zero.\nWe notice that in Eq. (7.33), g is the same\nfor all particles, and hence it comes out of the\nsummation. This gives, since g is non-zero,\n\u2211mi ir = 0. Remember that the position vectors\n(ri) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in\naccordance with the reasoning given below\nEq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7.2, if the sum is zero, the origin\nmust be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,\nthe centre of gravity of the body coincides with\nthe centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-\nfree space.

If\nthe body is so extended that g varies from part\nto part of the body, then the centre of gravity\nand centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,\nthe two are different concepts. The centre of\nmass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends\nonly on the distribution of mass of the body.\nIn Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the\ncentre of mass of several regular, homogeneous\nobjects. Obviously the method used there gives\nus also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if\nthey are small enough.\nFigure 7.25 illustrates another way of\ndetermining the CG of an irregular shaped body\nlike a cardboard. If you suspend the body from\nsome point like A, the vertical line through A\npasses through the CG. We mark the vertical\nAA1. We then suspend the body through other\npoints like B and C. The intersection of the\nverticals gives the CG. Explain why the method\nworks. Since the body is small enough, the\nmethod allows us to determine also its centre\nof mass.\nExample 7.8   A metal bar 70 cm long\nand 4.00 kg in mass supported on two\nknife-edges placed 10 cm from each end.\nA 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from\none end.

The rod is uniform in cross\nsection and homogeneous; hence G is at the\ncentre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP\n= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2 = 10 cm and K1G\n= K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod =4.00 kg and W1= suspended load = 6.00 kg;\nR1 and R2 are the normal reactions of the\nsupport at the knife edges.\nFor translational equilibrium of the rod,\nR1+R2 \u2013W1 \u2013W = 0 (i)\nNote W1 and W act vertically down and R1\nand R2 act vertically up.\nFor considering rotational equilibrium, we\ntake moments of the forces.

The moments of\nR2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the\nmoment of R1 is clockwise (-ve).\nFor rotational equilibrium,\n\u2013R1 (K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (K2G) = 0 (ii)\nIt is given that W = 4.00 g N and W1 = 6.00 g\nN, where g = acceleration due to gravity.

We have yet to answer\none major question in this connection. What is\nthe analogue of mass in rotational motion?\nWe shall attempt to answer this question in the\npresent section. To keep the discussion simple,\nwe shall consider rotation about a fixed axis\nonly. Let us try to get an expression for the\nkinetic energy of a rotating body . We know\nthat for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each\nparticle of the body moves in a circle with linear\nvelocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16).\nFor a particle at a distance from the axis, thelinear velocity is i ir \u03c5 \u03c9=. The kinetic energy of\nmotion of this particle is\n2 2 2 1 1\n2 2i i i i i k m m r \u03c5 \u03c9 = =\nwhere mi is the mass of the particle.

It is a\ncharacteristic of the rigid body and the axis\nabout which it rotates.\nCompare Eq.

We have already noted the analogy\nbetween angular velocity \u03c9 (in respect of rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in\nrespect of linear motion). It is then evident that\nthe parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired\nrotational analogue of mass  in linear motion . In\nrotation (about a fixed axis), the moment of inertia\nplays a similar role as mass does in linear motion.\nWe now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to\ncalculate the moment of inertia in two simple\ncases.\n(a)Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass\nM, rotating in its own plane around its centre\n2020-21",

The total mass of the system is M.\n(b)Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of\nlength of length l with a pair of small masses,\nrotating about an axis through the centre of\nmass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7.28).\nEach mass M /2 is at a distance l/2 from the\naxis. The moment of inertia of the masses is\ntherefore given by\n(M/2) (l/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2\nThus, for the pair of masses, rotating about\nthe axis through the centre of mass\nperpendicular to the rod\nI = Ml2 / 4\nTable 7.1 simply gives the moment of inertia of\nvarious familiar regular shaped bodies about\nspecific axes. (The deriv ations of these\nexpressions are beyond the scope of this textbook\nand you will study them in higher classes.)\nAs the mass of a body resists a change in its\nstate of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia\nin linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of\ninertia about a given axis of rotation resists a\nchange in its rotational motion, it can be\nregarded as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body; it is a measure of the way in which\ndifferent parts of the body are distributed at\ndifferent distances from the axis. Unlike the\nmass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a\nfixed quantity but depends on distribution of\nmass about the axis of rotation, and the\norientation and position of the axis of rotationwith respect to the body as a whole. As a\nmeasure of the way in which the mass of a\nrotating rigid body is distributed with respect to\nthe axis of rotation, we can define a new\nparameter, the radius of gyration . It is related\nto the moment of inertia and the total mass of\nthe body.\nNotice from the Table 7.1 that in all\ncases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has\nthe dimension of length. For a rod, about\nthe perpendicular  axis at its midpoint,\ni.e.2 212, k L=  = 12 k L . Similarly, k = R/2\nfor the circular disc about its diameter. The\nlength k is a geometric property of the body and\naxis of rotation. It is called the radius of\ngyration . The radius of gyration of a body\nabout an axis  may be defined as the distance\nfrom the axis of a mass point whose mass is\nequal to the mass of the whole body and whose\nmoment of inertia is equal to the moment of\ninertia of the body about the axis.\nThus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body\ndepends on the mass of the body, its shape and\nsize; distribution of mass about the axis of\nrotation, and the position and orientation of the\naxis of rotation.\nFrom the definition, Eq. (7.34), we can infer\nthat the dimensions of moments of inertia are\nML2 and its SI units are kg m2.\nThe property of this extremely important\nquantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body, has been put to a great practical use.\nThe machines, such as steam engine and the\nautomobile engine, etc., that produce rotational\nmotion have a disc with a large moment of\ninertia, called a flywheel . Because of its large\nmoment of inertia, the flywheel resists the\nsudden increase or decrease of the speed of the\nvehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed\nand prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring\na smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.\n7.10 THEOREMS OF PERPENDICULAR AND\nPARALLEL AXES\nThese are two useful theorems relating to\nmoment of inertia. We shall first discuss the\ntheorem of perpendicular axes and its simple\nyet instructive application in working out the\nmoments of inertia of some regular-shaped\nbodies.\n2020-21",

For\nexample, the angular velocity \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 plays the same\nrole in rotation as the linear velocity v in\ntranslation. We wish to take this analogy\nfurther. In doing so we shall restrict the\ndiscussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This\ncase of motion involves only one degree of\nfreedom, i.e., needs only one independent\nvariable to describe the motion. This in\ntranslation corresponds to linear motion. This\nsection is limited only to kinematics. We shall\nturn to dynamics in later sections.\nWe recall that for specifying the angular\ndisplacement of the rotating body we take any\nparticle like P (Fig.7.33) of the body. Its angular\ndisplacement \u03b8 in the plane it moves is the\nangular displacement of the whole body; \u03b8 is\nmeasured from a fixed direction in the plane of\nmotion of P, which we take to be the x\u2032-axis,\nchosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,\nthe axis of rotation is the z \u2013 axis and the plane\nof the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.\nFig. 7.33 also shows \u03b80, the angular\ndisplacement at t = 0.\nWe also recall that the angular velocity is\nthe time rate of change of angular displacement,\n\u03c9 = d\u03b8/dt.

Also, we know that in rotational\nmotion moment of inertia and torque play the\nsame role as mass and force respectively in\nlinear motion. Given this we should be able to\nguess what the other analogues indicated in the\ntable are. For example, we know that in linear\nmotion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational\nmotion about a fixed axis it should be d\u03c4 \u03b8,\nsince we already know the correspondence\nd dx \u03b8 \u2192  and F \u03c4\u2192. It is, however, necessary\nthat these correspondences are established on\nsound dynamical considerations. This is what\nwe now turn to.\nBefore we begin, we note a simplification\nthat arises in the case of rotational motion\nabout a fixed axis . Since the axis is fixed, only\nthose components of torques, which are along\nthe direction of the fixed axis need to be\nconsidered in our discussion. Only these\ncomponents can cause the body to rotate about\nthe axis. A component of the torque\nperpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend\nto turn the axis from its position. We specifically\nassume that there will arise necessary forces of\nconstraint to cancel the effect of the\nperpendicular components of the (external)\ntorques, so that the fixed position of the axis\nwill be maintained. The perpendicular\ncomponents of the torques, therefore need not\nbe taken into account. This means that for our\ncalculation of torques on a rigid body:(1)We need to consider only those forces that\nlie in planes perpendicular to the axis.\nForces which are parallel to the axis will\ngive torques perpendicular to the axis and\nneed not be taken into account.\n(2)We need to consider only those components\nof the position vectors which are\nperpendicular to the axis. Components of\nposition vectors along the axis will result in\ntorques perpendicular to the axis and need\nnot be taken into account.\nWork done by a torque\nFig. 7.34 Work done by a force F1 acting on a particle\nof a body rotating about a fixed axis; the\nparticle describes a circular path with\ncentre C on the axis;  arc P1P\u20321(ds1) gives\nthe displacement of the particle.\nFigure 7.34 shows a cross-section of a rigid\nbody rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken\nas the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the\npage; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to\nconsider only those forces which lie in planes\nperpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such\ntypical force acting as shown on a particle of\nthe body at point P1 with its line of action in a\nplane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience\nwe call  this to be the x\u2032\u2013y\u2032 plane (coincident\nwith the plane of the page). The particle at P1\ndescribes a circular path of radius r1 with centre\nC on the axis; CP1 = r1.\nIn time \u2206t, the point moves to the position\nP1\u2032. The displacement of the particle ds1,\ntherefore, has magnitude d s1 = r1d\u03b8 and\ndirection tangential at P1 to the circular path\nas shown. Here d \u03b8 is the angular displacement\nof the particle, d \u03b8 = 1 1P CP\u2220 \u2032.The work done by\nthe force on the particle is\ndW1 = F1. ds1= F1ds1 cos\u03c61= F1(r1 d\u03b8)sin\u03b11\nwhere \u03c61 is the angle between F1 and the tangent\n2020-21",

Further, v is tangential\nat P to the circle which the particle describes.\nUsing the right-hand rule one can check that\nCP \u00d7 v is parallel to the fixed axis.

Compare this with the corresponding\nfact in translation. For a particle, p and v are\nalways parallel to each other.\nFor computing the total angular momentum\nof the whole rigid body, we add up the\ncontribution of each particle of the body.\nThus\nWe denote by \u22a5L and zL the components of\nL respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and\nalong the z-axis;\nL OC v\u22a5= \u00d7\u2211 i i im (7.44a)\nwhere mi and vi are respectively the mass and\nthe velocity of the ith particle and Ci is the centre\nof the circle described by the particle;\nand\nor \u02c6\u03c9=L kzI (7.44b)\nThe last step follows since the perpendicular\ndistance of the ith particle from the axis is ri;\nand by definition the moment of inertia of the\nbody about the axis of rotation is I m ri i =\u22112.Notez \u22a5 = +L L L (7.44c)\nThe rigid bodies which we have mainly\nconsidered in this chapter are symmetric about\nthe axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is\none of their symmetry axes. For such bodies,\nfor a given OCi, for every particle which has a\nvelocity vi , there is another particle of velocity\n\u2013vi  located diametrically opposite on the circle\nwith centre Ci described by the particle. Together\nsuch pairs will contribute zero to \u22a5L and as a\nresult for symmetric bodies \u22a5L is zero, and\nhence\n\u02c6\u03c9 = =L L kzI (7.44d)\nFor bodies, which are not symmetric about\nthe axis of rotation, L is not equal to Lz and\nhence L does not lie along the axis of rotation.\nReferring to Table 7.1, can you tell in which\ncases L = Lz will not apply?\nLet us differentiate Eq.

This means we can take \u02c6\u03c4=k \u03c4\u03c4 \u03c4\u03c4 .\nSince z \u22a5 = +L L L  and the direction of Lz (vector\n\u02c6k) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a\nfixed axis,\nd\u02c6\nd\u03c4=Lkz\nt(7.45a)\nand d0dt\u22a5=L(7.45b)\nThus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the\ncomponent of angular momentum\nperpendicular to the fixed axis is constant.

You may do this experiment with\nyour friend.  Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a\nseat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms\nfolded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from,\nthe ground.  Ask your friend to rotate the chair\nrapidly. While the chair is rotating withconsiderable angular speed stretch your arms\nhorizontally.  What happens?  Your angular\nspeed is reduced.  If you bring back your arms\ncloser to your body, the angular speed increases\nagain.  This is a situation where the principle of\nconservation of angular momentum is\napplicable.  If friction in the rotational\nmechanism is neglected, there is no external\ntorque about the axis of rotation of the chair\nand hence I\u03c9 is constant.  Stretching the arms\nincreases I about the axis of rotation, resulting\nin decreasing the angular speed \u03c9.  Bringing\nthe arms closer to the body has the opposite\neffect.\nA circus acrobat and a diver take advantage\nof this principle.

All wheels used\nin transportation have rolling motion.  For\nspecificness we shall begin with the case of a\ndisc, but the result will apply to any rolling body\nrolling on a level surface.  We shall assume that\nthe disc rolls without slipping.  This means that\nat any instant of time the bottom of the disc\nFig 7.36 (a) A demonstration of conservation of\nangular momentum.

We\nknow that the translational motion of a system\nof particles is the motion of its centre of mass.\nFig. 7.37 The rolling motion (without slipping) of a\ndisc on a level surface. Note at any instant,\nthe point of contact P0 of the disc with the\nsurface is at rest; the centre of mass of\nthe disc moves with velocity, vcm. The disc\nrotates with angular velocity \u03c9about its\naxis which passes through C; vcm =R\u03c9,\nwhere R is the radius of the disc.\nLet vcm be the velocity of the centre of mass\nand therefore the translational velocity of the\ndisc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc\nis at its geometric centre C (Fig. 7. 37), vcm is\nthe velocity of C.  It is parallel to the level\nsurface.  The rotational motion of the disc is\nabout its symmetry axis, which passes through\nC.  Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc,\nlike P0, P1 or P2, consists of two parts, one is the\ntranslational velocity vcm and the other is the\nlinear velocity vr on account of rotation. The\nmagnitude of  vr is vr = r\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the angular\nvelocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis\nand r is the distance of the point from the axis\n(i.e. from C).  The velocity vr is directed\nperpendicular to the radius vector of the given\npoint with respect to C.  In Fig. 7.37, the velocity\nof the point P2 (v2) and its components  vr and\nvcm are shown;  vr here is perpendicular to CP2 .\nIt is easy to show that vz is perpendicular to the\nline POP2. Therefore the line passing through PO\nand parallel to \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 is called the instantaneous axis\nof rotation.At Po, the linear velocity, vr, due to rotation\nis directed exactly opposite to the translational\nvelocity vcm. Further the magnitude of  vr here is\nR\u03c9, where R is the radius of the disc. The\ncondition that Po is instantaneously at rest\nrequires vcm  = R\u03c9. Thus for the disc the condition\nfor rolling without slipping is\n\u03c5 \u03c9cmR= (7.47)\nIncidentally, this means that the velocity of\npoint P1 at the top of the disc ( v1) has a\nmagnitude vcm+ R\u03c9 or 2 vcm and is directed\nparallel to the level surface. The condition (7.47)\napplies to all rolling bodies.\n7.14.1 Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion\nOur next task will be to obtain an expression\nfor the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The\nkinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated\ninto kinetic energy of translation and kinetic\nenergy of rotation. This is a special case of a\ngeneral result for a system of particles,\naccording to which the kinetic energy of a\nsystem of particles ( K) can be separated into\nthe kinetic energy of translational motion of the\ncentre of mass ( MV2/2) and kinetic energy of\nrotational motion about the centre of mass of\nthe system of particles ( K\u2032). Thus,\n(7.48)\nWe assume  this general result (see Exercise\n7.31), and apply it to the case of rolling motion.\nIn our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre\nof mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation,\nof the rolling body is mv2\ncm /2, where m is the\nmass of the body and vcm is the centre of the\nmass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling\nbody about the centre of mass is rotation, K\u2032\nrepresents the kinetic energy of rotation of the\nbody; , where I is the moment of\ninertia about the appropriate axis, which is the\nsymmetry axis of the rolling bo dy. The kinetic\nenergy of  a rolling body, therefore, is given by\n(7.49a)\nSubstituting I = mk2 where k = the\ncorresponding radius of gyration of the body\nand vcm= R \u03c9, we get\nor  (7.49b)\n2020-21",

In general, the angular momentum L for such a\nbody is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of\nrotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, zL I= =L \u03c9. The angular\nacceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by I\u03b1 = \u03c4. If the external\ntorque \u03c4 acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the\nfixed axis (say, z-axis), Lz (=I\u03c9) of such a rotating body is constant.\n17.For rolling motion without slipping vcm = R\u03c9, where vcm  is the velocity of translation (i.e.\nof the centre of mass), R is the radius and m is the mass of the body. The kinetic energy\nof such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation:\n2 2 1 1\n2 2cm K m v I= + \u03c9.\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal\nforces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external\nforces on the body.\n2.Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,\nthe translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of\nmass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K\u2032 and the kinetic energy of\nthe centre of mass MV2/2,\n      K = K\u2032 + MV2/2\n3.Newton\u2019s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton\u2019s\nSecond Law and also Newton\u2019s Third Law for particles.\n4.To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\nparticles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton\u2019s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton\u2019s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n5.The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque\nare independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total\nexternal force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.\n6.The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is\nzero.\n7.The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational\nfield does not vary from one part of the body to the other.\n8.The angular momentum L and the angular velocity \u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 are not necessarily parallel vectors.\nHowever, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a\nfixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation L = I\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 holds good,\nwhere I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.\n2020-21",

    "content": "184 PHYSICS\nB\nA\nCPS S'2b\n2aCopernicus (1473-1543) proposed a definitive\nmodel in which the planets moved in circles\naround a fixed central sun.  His theory was\ndiscredited by the church, but notable amongst\nits supporters was Galileo who had to face\nprosecution from the state for his beliefs.\nIt was around the same time as Galileo, a\nnobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)\nhailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime\nrecording observations of the planets with the\nnaked eye.  His compiled data were analysed\nlater by his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571-\n1640). He could extract from the data three\nelegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler\u2019s\nlaws.  These laws were known to Newton and\nenabled him to make a great scientific leap in\nproposing his universal law of gravitation.\n8.2  KEPLER\u2019S LAWS\nThe three laws of Kepler can be stated as follows:\n1.  Law of orbits :  All planets move in elliptical\norbits with the Sun situated at one of the  foci\nFig. 8.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around\nthe sun. The closest point is P and the\nfarthest point is A, P is called the\nperihelion and A the aphelion. The\nsemimajor axis is half the distance AP.\nFig. 8.1(b) Drawing an ellipse. A string has its ends\nfixed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds\nthe string taut and is moved around.of the ellipse (Fig. 8.1a). This law was a  deviation\nfrom the Copernican model which allowed only\ncircular orbits. The ellipse, of which the circle is\na special case, is a closed curve which can be\ndrawn very simply as follows.\nSelect two points F1 and F2.  Take a length\nof a string and  fix its ends at F1 and F2 by pins.\nWith the tip of a pencil  stretch the string taut\nand then draw a curve by moving the pencil\nkeeping the string taut throughout.(Fig. 8.1(b))\nThe closed curve you get is called an ellipse.\nClearly for any point T on the ellipse, the sum of\nthe distances from F1 and F2 is a constant.  F1,\nF2 are called the focii. Join the points F1 and  F2\nand extend   the line to intersect the ellipse at\npoints P and A as shown in Fig. 8.1(b). The\nmidpoint of the line PA is the centre of the ellipse\nO and the length PO = AO  is called the semi-\nmajor axis of the ellipse. For a circle, the two\nfocii  merge into one  and the semi-major axis\nbecomes the radius of the circle.\n2. Law of areas :  The line that joins any planet\nto the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal intervals\nof time (Fig. 8.2).  This law comes from the\nobservations that planets appear to move slower\nwhen they are  farther from the sun than when\nthey are nearer.\nFig. 8.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an\nelliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area\n\u2206A swept out in a small interval of time  \u2206t.\n3. Law of periods :  The square of the time period\nof revolution of a planet is proportional to the\ncube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced\nout by  the planet.\nTable 8.1 gives the approximate time periods\nof revolution of eight*  planets around the sun\nalong with values of their semi-major axes.\n*Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182\n2020-21",

Let the Sun be at the origin and let\nthe position and momentum of the planet be\ndenoted by r and p   respectively. Then the area\nswept out by the planet of mass m in time\ninterval \u2206t is (Fig. 8.2) \u2206 A given by\n\u2206A = \u00bd  (r \u00d7 v\u2206t) (8.1)\n Hence\n\u2206A/\u2206t   =\u00bd  (r \u00d7 p)/m, (since  v = p/m)\n                       =    L / (2 m) (8.2)\nwhere v is the velocity,  L is the angular\nmomentum equal  to   ( r  \u00d7  p).  For a central\nforce, which is directed along r, L is  a constantas the planet goes around. Hence,  \u2206A/\u2206t is a\nconstant according to the last equation. This is\nthe law of areas. Gravitation is a central force\nand hence the law of areas follows.\nExample 8.1   Let  the speed of the planet\nat  the  perihelion P in Fig. 8.1(a) be vP  and\nthe Sun-planet distance SP be rP. Relate\n{rP, vP} to the corresponding quantities at\nthe aphelion { rA, vA}. Will the planet take\nequal times to traverse BAC and CPB ?\nAnswer   The magnitude of the angular\nmomentum at P is Lp =  m p rp vp, since inspection\ntells us that rp and vp are mutually\nperpendicular. Similarly, LA = m p rA vA. From\nangular momentum conservation\nmp rp vp = m p rA vA\norv\nvp\nA=r\nrA\np/triangleleft\nSince rA   > r p, vp > vA .\nThe area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and\nthe radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC\nin Fig. 8.1. From Kepler\u2019s second law, equal areas\nare swept in equal times. Hence the planet will\ntake a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.\n8.3  UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION\nLegend has it that observing an apple falling\nfrom a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an\nuniversal law of gravitation that led to an\nexplanation of terrestrial  gravitation as well as\nof Kepler\u2019s laws.  Newton\u2019s reasoning was that\nthe moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was\nsubject to a centripetal acceleration due to\nearth\u2019s gravity of magnitude\n2 2\n24m\nm\nmR VaR T\u03c0= = (8.3)\nwhere V is the speed of the moon related to the\ntime period T  by the relation 2 /m V R T \u03c0= . The\ntime period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was\nalready known then to be about 3.84 \u00d7 108m.  If\nwe substitute these numbers in Eq. (8.3), we\nget a value of am much smaller than the value of\nacceleration due to gravity g on the surface of\nthe earth, arising also due to earth\u2019s gravitational\nattraction.Johannes Kepler\n(1571\u20131630)  was a\nscientist of German\norigin. He formulated\nthe three laws of\nplanetary motion based\non the painstaking\nobservations of Tycho\nBrahe and coworkers. Kepler himself was an\nassistant to Brahe and it took him sixteen long\nyears to arrive at the three planetary laws. He\nis also known as the founder of geometrical\noptics, being the first to describe what happens\nto light after it enters a telescope.\n*Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182\n2020-21",

This happens either when F is zero or when F is along r. We are\ninterested in forces which satisfy the latter condition. Central forces satisfy this condition.\nA \u2018central\u2019 force is always directed towards or away from a fixed point, i.e., along the position\nvector of the point of application of the force with respect to the fixed point. (See Figure below.)\nFurther, the magnitude of a central force F depends on r, the distance of the point of application\nof the force from the fixed point; F = F(r).\nIn the motion under a central force the angular momentum is always conserved. Two important\nresults follow from this:\n(1)The motion of a particle under the central force is always confined to a plane.\n(2)The position vector of the particle with respect to the centre of the force (i.e. the fixed point)\nhas a constant areal velocity. In other words the position vector sweeps out equal areas in\nequal times as the particle moves under the influence of the central force.\nTry to prove both these results. You may need to know that the areal velocity is given by :\ndA/dt = \u00bd r v sin \u03b1.\nAn immediate application of the above discussion can be made to the motion of a planet\nunder the gravitational force of the sun. For convenience the sun may be taken to be so heavy\nthat it is at rest. The gravitational force of the sun on the planet is directed towards the sun.\nThis force also satisfies the requirement F = F(r) , since F = G m1m2/r2 where m1 and m2 are\nrespectively the masses of the planet and the sun and G is the universal constant of gravitation.\nThe two results (1) and (2) described above, therefore, apply to the motion of the planet. In fact,\nthe result (2) is the well-known second law of Kepler.\nTr is the trejectory of the particle under the central force. At a position P, the force is directed\nalong OP , O is the centre of the force taken as the origin. In time \u2206t, the particle moves from P to P \u2032,\narc PP \u2032 = \u2206s = v \u2206 t.

The force on point mass m1\ndue to m2 is of course \u2013 F by Newton\u2019s third law.\nThus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1\ndue to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related\nas F12 = \u2013 F21.\nBefore we can apply Eq. (8.5) to objects under\nconsideration, we have to be careful since the\nlaw refers to point  masses whereas we deal with\nextended objects which have finite size. If we have\na collection of point masses, the force on any\none of them is the vector sum of the gravitational\nforces exerted by the other point masses as\nshown in Fig 8.4.\nFig. 8.4 Gravitational force on point mass m1 is the\nvector sum of the gravitational forces exerted\nby m2, m3 and m4.\nThe total force on m1 is\n2 1\n1 2\n21Gm m\nr=F$ 3 1212\n31Gm m\nr+r $ $ 4 131 412\n41Gm m\nr+r r\nExample 8.2   Three equal masses of m kg\neach are fixed at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle ABC.\n(a) What is the force acting on a mass 2 m\nplaced at the centroid G of the triangl e?\n(b) What is the force if the mass at the\nvertex A is doubled ?\n      Take AG = BG = CG = 1 m (see Fig. 8.5)\nAnswer   (a) The angle between GC and the\npositive x-axis is 30\u00b0 and so is the angle between\nGB and the negative x-axis.

(8.5) is not\ndirectly applicable. Each point mass in the extended\nobject will exert a force on the given point mass and\nthese force will not all be in the same direction. We\nhave to add up these forces vectorially  for all the point\nmasses in the extended object to get the total force.\nThis is easily done using calculus. For two special\ncases, a  simple law results when you do that :\n(1)The force of attraction between a hollow\nspherical shell of uniform density and a\npoint mass situated outside is just as if\nthe entire mass of the shell is\nconcentrated at the centre of the shell.\nQualitatively this can be understood as\nfollows: Gravitational forces caused by the\nvarious regions of the shell have components\nalong the line joining the point mass to the\ncentre as well as along a direction\nprependicular to this line. The components\nprependicular to this line cancel out when\nsumming over all regions of the shell leaving\nonly a resultant force along the line joining\nthe point to the centre. The magnitude of\nthis force works out to be as stated above.\nNewton\u2019s Principia\nKepler had formulated his third law by 1619. The announcement of the underlying universal law of\ngravitation came about seventy years later with the publication in 1687 of Newton\u2019s masterpiece\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica , often simply called the Principia .\n  Around 1685, Edmund Halley (after whom the famous Halley\u2019s comet is named), came to visit\nNewton at Cambridge and asked him about the nature of the trajectory of a body moving under the\ninfluence of an inverse square law. Without hesitation Newton replied that it had to be an ellipse,\nand further that he had worked it out long ago around 1665 when he was forced to retire to his farm\nhouse from Cambridge on account of a plague outbreak. Unfortunately, Newton had lost his papers.\nHalley prevailed upon Newton to produce his work in book form and agreed to bear the cost of\npublication. Newton accomplished this feat in eighteen months of superhuman effort. The Principia\nis a singular scientific masterpiece and in the words of Lagrange it is \u201cthe greatest production of the\nhuman mind.\u201d The Indian born astrophysicist and Nobel laureate S. Chandrasekhar spent ten years\nwriting a treatise on the Principia .

Various regions of the spherical shell\nattract the point mass inside it in various\ndirections. These forces cancel each other\ncompletely.\n8.4  THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT\nThe value of the gravitational constant G\nentering the Universal law of gravitation  can be\ndetermined experimentally and this was first\ndone by English scientist Henry Cavendish in\n1798. The apparatus used by him is\nschematically shown in figure.8.6\nFig. 8.6 Schematic drawing of Cavendish\u2019s\nexperiment. S1 and S2 are large spheres\nwhich are kept on either side (shown shades)\nof the masses at A and B. When the big\nspheres are taken to the other side of the\nmasses (shown by dotted circles), the bar\nAB rotates a little since the torque reverses\ndirection. The angle of rotation can be\nmeasured experimentally.\nThe bar AB has two small lead spheres\nattached at its ends.  The bar is suspended from\na rigid support by a fine wire.  Two large lead\nspheres are brought close to the small ones but\non opposite sides as shown.  The big spheres\nattract the nearby small ones by equal and\nopposite force as shown.  There is no net force\non the bar but only a torque which is clearly\nequal to F times the length of the bar,where F is\nthe force of attraction between a big sphere andits neighbouring small sphere.  Due to this\ntorque, the suspended wire  gets twisted till such\ntime as the restoring torque of the wire equals\nthe gravitational torque .  If \u03b8 is the angle of twist\nof the suspended wire, the restoring torque is\nproportional to \u03b8, equal to \u03c4\u03b8. Where \u03c4 is the\nrestoring couple per unit angle of twist. \u03c4 can be\nmeasured independently e.g. by applying a\nknown torque and measuring the angle of twist.\nThe gravitational force between the spherical\nballs is the same as if their masses are\nconcentrated at their centres.  Thus if d is the\nseparation between the centres of the big and\nits neighbouring small ball, M and m their\nmasses, the gravitational force between the big\nsphere and its neighouring small ball is.\n2MmF Gd= (8.6)\nIf   L  is the length of  the bar AB , then the\ntorque arising out of F  is  F  multiplied by L. At\nequilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque\nand hence\n2MmG Ld\u03c4 \u03b8= (8.7)\nObservation of \u03b8 thus enables one to\ncalculate G from this equation.\nSince Cavendish\u2019s  experiment, the\nmeasurement of G has been refined and the\ncurrently accepted value is\nG = 6.67\u00d710-11  N m2/kg2(8.8)\n8.5ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF\nTHE EARTH\nThe earth can be imagined to be a sphere made\nof a large number of concentric spherical shells\nwith the smallest one at the centre and the\nlargest one at its surface.  A point outside the\nearth  is obviously outside all the shells.  Thus,\nall the shells exert a gravitational force at the\npoint outside just as if their masses are\nconcentrated at their common centre according\nto the result stated in section 8.3. The total mass\nof all the shells combined is just the mass of the\nearth.  Hence, at a point outside the earth, the\ngravitational force is just as if its entire mass of\nthe earth is concentrated at its centre.\nFor a point inside the earth, the situation\nis different.  This is illustrated in Fig. 8.7.\n2020-21",

The\npoint  P lies outside the sphere of radius r.  For\nthe shells of radius greater than r, the point P\nlies inside.  Hence according to result stated in\nthe last section, they exert no gravitational force\non mass m kept at P.  The shells with radius \u2264r\nmake up a sphere of radius r for which the point\nP lies on the surface.  This smaller sphere\ntherefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if\nits mass Mr is concentrated at the centre.

The measurement of G by\nCavendish\u2019s experiment (or otherwise), combined\nwith knowledge of g and RE enables one to\nestimate ME from Eq. (8.12).

The force on m due to the outer\nshell of thickness  d is zero because the result\nquoted in the previous section. As far as the\nsmaller  sphere of radius  ( RE  \u2013 d  ) is concerned,\nthe point mass is outside it and hence according\nto the result quoted earlier, the force due to this\nsmaller sphere is just as if the entire mass of\nthe smaller sphere is concentrated at the centre.\nIf Ms  is the mass of the smaller sphere, then,\nMs/ME = ( RE \u2013 d)3  / RE3( 8.16)\nSince  mass of a sphere is proportional to be\ncube of its radius.\nFig. 8.8 (b)g at a depth d.

If the position of the particle\nchanges on account of forces acting on it, then\nthe change in its potential energy is just the\namount of work done on the body by the force.\nAs we had discussed earlier, forces for which\nthe work done is independent of the path are\nthe conservative forces.\nThe force of gravity is a conservative force\nand we can calculate the potential energy of a\nbody arising out of this force, called the\ngravitational potential energy. Consider points\nclose to the surface of earth, at distances from\nthe surface much smaller than the radius of the\nearth.  In such cases, the force of gravity is\npractically a constant equal to mg, directed\ntowards the centre of the earth.  If we consider\na point at a height h1 from the surface of the\nearth and another point vertically above it at a\nheight h2 from the surface, the work done in\nlifting the particle of mass m from the first to\nthe second position is denoted by W12\nW12 = Force \u00d7 displacement\n      = mg (h2 \u2013 h1) (8.20)Ms ME\n2020-21",

Thus,  Wo  is the  potential energy on the\nsurface of the earth.\nIf we consider points at arbitrary distance\nfrom the surface of the earth, the result just\nderived is not valid since the assumption that\nthe gravitational force mg is a constant is no\nlonger valid.

Thus,  W1  is the\npotential energy at infinity. One should note that\nonly the difference of potential energy between\ntwo points has a definite meaning  from Eqs.\n(8.22) and (8.24). One conventionally sets  W1\nequal to zero, so that the potential energy at a\npoint is just the amount of work done in\ndisplacing the particle from infinity to that point.We have  calculated the potential energy at\na point of a particle  due to gravitational forces\non it due to the earth and it is proportional to\nthe mass of the particle. The gravitational\npotential due to the gravitational force of the\nearth is defined as the potential energy of  a\nparticle of unit mass at that point.

Of course using machines we can\nshoot an object with much greater speeds and\nwith greater and greater initial speed, the object\nscales higher and higher heights. A natural\nquery that arises in our mind is the following:\n\u2018can we throw an object with such high initial\nspeeds that it does not fall back to the earth?\u2019\nThe principle of conservation of energy helps\nus to answer this question. Suppose the object\ndid reach infinity and that its speed there was\nVf. The energy of an object is the sum of potential\nand kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that\ngravitational potential energy of the object at\ninfinity. The total energy of the projectile at\ninfinity then is\n2\n1 ( )2fmV\nE W\u221e = + (8.26)\nIf the object was thrown initially with a speed\nVi from a point at a distance ( h+RE) from the\ncentre of the earth ( RE = radius of the earth), its\nenergy initially was\n2\n11( ) \u20132 ( )E\nE i\nEGmM\nE h R mV Wh R+ = ++(8.27)\nBy the principle of energy conservation\nEqs.

This is called the escape\nspeed, sometimes loosely called the escape\nvelocity.\nEquation (8.32) applies equally well to an\nobject thrown from the surface of the moon with\ng replaced by the acceleration due to Moon\u2019s\ngravity on its surface and rE replaced by the\nradius of the moon. Both are smaller than their\nvalues on earth and the escape speed for the\nmoon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times\nsmaller. This is the reason that moon has no\natmosphere. Gas molecules if formed on the\nsurface of the moon having velocities larger than\nthis will escape the gravitational pull of the\nmoon.\nExample 8.4   Two uniform solid spheres\nof equal radii R, but mass M and 4 M have\na centre to centre separation 6 R, as shown\nin Fig. 8.10.

Their motion is very similar to the\nmotion of planets around the Sun and hence\nKepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion are equally\napplicable to them.  In particular, their orbits\naround the earth are circular or elliptic.  Moon\nis the only natural satellite of the earth with a\nnear circular orbit with a time period of\napproximately 27.3 days which is also roughly\nequal to the rotational period of the moon aboutits own axis.  Since, 1957, advances in\ntechnology have enabled many countries\nincluding India to launch artificial earth\nsatellites for practical use in fields like\ntelecommunication, geophysics and\nmeteorology.\nWe will consider a satellite in a circular orbit\nof a distance ( RE + h) from the centre of the earth,\nwhere RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass\nof the satellite and V  its speed, the centripetal\nforce required for this orbit is\nF(centripetal) = 2\n( )EmV\nR h+(8.33)\ndirected towards the centre.  This centripetal force\nis provided by the gravitational force, which is\nF(gravitation) = 2( )E\nEG m M\nR h+(8.34)\nwhere ME is the mass of the earth.\nEquating R.H.S of Eqs. (8.33) and (8.34) and\ncancelling out m, we get\n2\n( )E\nEG MVR h=+(8.35)\nThus V decreases as h increases.  From\nequation (8.35),the speed V  for  h = 0  is\n2( 0) /E E V h GM R gR = = = (8.36)\nwhere we have used the relation\ng =2/E GM R . In every orbit, the satellite\ntraverses a distance 2\u03c0 (RE + h) with speed V .  Its\ntime period T therefore is\n3 /22 ( ) 2 ( )E E\nER h R hTV G M\u03c0 \u03c0 + += =(8.37)\non substitution of value of V from Eq. (8.35).\nSquaring both sides  of  Eq.

For a\nsatellite very close to the surface of earth h can\nbe neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (8.38).\nHence, for such satellites, T is To, where\n02 /E T R g \u03c0= (8.39)\nIf we substitute the numerical values\ng /asymptequal 9.8 m s-2 and RE = 6400 km., we get\n6\n06.4 1029.8T \u03c0\u00d7=  s\nWhich is approximately 85 minutes.\n2020-21",

Satellites in a\ncircular orbits around the earth in the\nequatorial plane with T = 24 hours are called\nGeostationery Satellites. Clearly, since the earth\nrotates with the same period, the satellite would\nappear fixed from any point on earth. It takes\nvery powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to\nsuch large heights above the earth but this has\nbeen done in view of the several benefits of many\npractical applications.\nFig. 8.11 A Polar satellite.

Radio waves used for radio\nbroadcast which are in the frequency range 2\nMHz to 10 MHz, are below the critical frequency.\nThey are therefore reflected by the ionosphere.\n2020-21",

Waves used in television\nbroadcast or other forms of communication have\nmuch higher frequencies and thus cannot be\nreceived beyond the line of sight.  A Geostationery\nsatellite, appearing fixed above the broadcasting\nstation can however receive these signals and\nbroadcast them back to a wide area on earth.\nThe INSAT  group of satellites sent up by India\nare one such group of Geostationary satellites\nwidely used for telecommunications in India.\nAnother class of satellites are called the Polar\nsatellites (Fig. 8.11).  These are low altitude ( h l\n500 to 800 km) satellites, but they go around\nthe poles of the earth in a north-south direction\nwhereas the earth rotates around its axis in an\neast-west direction. Since its time period is\naround 100 minutes it crosses any altitude many\ntimes a day.

We are conscious of our own\nweight when we stand on a surface, since the\nsurface exerts a force opposite to our weight to\nkeep us at rest. The same principle holds good\nwhen we measure the weight of an object by a\nspring balance hung from a fixed point e.g. the\nceiling. The object would fall down unless it is\nsubject to a force opposite to gravity.  This is\nexactly what the spring exerts on the object. This\nis because  the spring is  pulled down a little by\nthe gravitational pull of the object and in turn the\nspring exerts a force on the object vertically upwards.\nNow, imagine that the top end of the balance\nis no longer held fixed to the top ceiling of the\nroom.  Both ends of the spring as well as the\nobject move with identical acceleration g.  The\nspring is not stretched and does not exert any\nupward force on the object which is moving down\nwith acceleration g due to gravity.  The reading     India\u2019s Leap into Space\nIndia started its space programme in 1962 when Indian National Committee for Space Research was set\nup by the Government of India which was superseded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\nin 1969. ISRO identified the role and importance of space technology in nation\u2019s development and\nbringing space to the service of the common man. India launched its first low orbit satellite Aryabhata in\n1975, for which the launch vehicle was provided by the erstwhile Soviet Union. ISRO started employing its\nindigenous launching vehicle in 1979 by sending Rohini series of satellites into space from its main\nlaunch site at Satish Dhawan Space Center, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The tremendous progress in\nIndia\u2019s space programme has made ISRO one of the six largest space agencies in the world. ISRO\ndevelops and delivers application specific satellite products and tools for broadcasts, communication,\nweather forecasts, disaster management tools, Geographic Information System, cartography, navigation,\ntelemedicine, dedicated distance education satellite etc. In order to achieve complete self-reliance in\nthese applications, cost effective and reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) was developed in\nearly 1990s. PSLV has thus become a favoured carrier for satellites of various countries, promoting\nunprecedented international collaboration. In 2001, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)\nwas developed for launching heavier and more demanding Geosynchronous communication satellites.\nVarious research centers and autonomous institutions for remote sensing, astronomy and astrophysics,\natmospheric sciences and space research are functioning under the aegis of the Department of Space,\nGovernment of India. Success of lunar (Chandrayaan) and inter planetary (Mangalyaan) missions along\nwith other scientific projects has been landmark achievements of ISRO. Future endeavors of ISRO in-\nclude human space flight projects, the development of heavy lift launchers, reusable launch vehicles,\nsemi-cryogenic engines, single and two stage to orbit (SSTO and TSTO) vehicles, development and use of\ncomposite materials for space application etc. In 1984 Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to go into\nouter space aboard in a USSR spaceship.

Let F1, F2, \u2026.Fn\nbe the individual forces due to M1, M2, \u2026.Mn, each given by the law of gravitation. From\nthe principle of superposition each force acts independently  and uninfluenced by the\nother bodies. The resultant force FR is then found by vector addition\nFR  =  F1 + F2 + \u2026\u2026+ Fn   =  Fi\nin\n=\u2211\n1\nwhere the symbol \u2018 \u03a3\u2019 stands for summation.\n3.Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion state that\n(a)All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points\n(b)The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal\ntime intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is\ncentral and hence angular momentum is conserved.\n(c)The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the   semi-\nmajor axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet\nThe period T and radius R of the circular orbit of a planet about the Sun are related\nby\n32\n2 4  RM  GT\ns\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\u03c0=\nwhere Ms is the mass of the Sun.

If the object were\na human being, he or she will not feel his weight\nsince there is no upward force on him.  Thus,\nwhen an object is in free fall, it is weightless and\nthis phenomenon is usually called the\nphenomenon of weightlessness.\nIn a satellite around the earth, every part\nand parcel of the satellite has an acceleration\ntowards the centre of the earth which is exactlythe value of earth\u2019s acceleration due to gravity\nat that position. Thus in the satellite everything\ninside it is in a state of free fall.  This is just as if\nwe were falling towards the earth from a height.\nThus, in a manned satellite, people inside\nexperience no gravity.  Gravity for us defines the\nvertical direction and thus for them there are no\nhorizontal or vertical directions, all directions are\nthe same.  Pictures of astronauts floating in a\nsatellite  show this fact.\n2020-21",

However, it is not special\nto the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.\n3.In Kepler\u2019s third law (see Eq. (8.1) and  T2 = KS R3. The constant KS is the same for all\nplanets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (8.38)].\n4.An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the\ngravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut\nand the satellite are in \u201cfree fall\u201d towards the Earth.\n5.The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance\nr is given by\nVG m m\nr= +\u20131 2constant\nThe constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With\nthis choice\nVG m m\nr=\u20131 2\nThis choice implies that V \u2192  0 as r \u2192  \u221e.  Choosing location of zero of the gravitational\nenergy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that\nthe gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.\n6.The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always\npositive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential\nenergy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is\nnegative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.\n7.The commonly encountered expression m g h  for the potential energy is actually an\napproximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the\npoint 6, above.\n8.Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two\nfinite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a\nspherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if\nthe mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.\n9.The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, (unlike a\nmetallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside\nit from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not\npossible .\nEXERCISES\n8.1 Answer the following :\n(a)You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor.\nCan you shield a body from the gravitational influence of nearby matter by putting\nit inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ?\n(b)An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect\ngravity.
